<h1>BOOK SYNOPSIS & REVIEW</H1><br><a href='https://bookdownloadpagehere.blogspot.com/'>Source|Download|Full Content</a><h2>The Three Abrahamic Testaments: How the Torah, Gospels, and Qur&#39;an Hold the Keys for Healing Our Fears (Islamic Encounter Series)</h2><p><b>The question remains: Why can't we all just get along?</b>Violence pours into our lives everyday through the media from around the world and in our neighborhoods. Religion, which should be a source of peace, is often right at the center of this violence. And the three Abrahamic faiths of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam are engaged in complex relations of reciprocity and recrimination.<br><br>In this volatile climate, a Muslim doctor, Ejaz Naqvi, writes as a champion for seeing the Three Testaments&#x2015;the Torah, the New Testament, and the Qur'an&#x2015;as sources of peace for all humanity. A healer by profession, Dr. Naqvi shows how the Three Abrahamic Testaments share major values and beliefs (oneness of God, the golden rule) while not diminishing differences between the three faiths. His message is simple:&nbsp;<i>You don't have to be wrong for me to be right.</i></p><p><b>Ejaz Naqvi, MD</b> is the immediate past president of Islamic Center of Zahra in Pleasanton, CA, and has been lecturing on Islam around the country.&nbsp;He serves on the executive board of the Interfaith Council of Contra Costa County, California and is actively engaged in interfaith work. He also serves on the Board of Directors of Islamic Scholarship Fund, a non-profit organization that aims to promote engagement of American Muslim students in mainstream through educational scholarships and mentorship programs. Dr. Ejaz Naqvi was the host of the internet radio talk show titled " Frank Talk with Dr. Ejaz- The Forum for Civil dialogue on Religion, spirituality and Wellness" on Toginet Radio in 2013, and has appeared as a guest on numerous radio programs nationally.<br>A practicing physician and a "born-again Muslim" after reading the Quranic translation for the first time in its entirety about two decades ago, he has since then pondered over the verses of the Quran and discovered that many of its teachings remain arcane. Eager and in search of finding the common grounds, his subsequent study of the Quran and the Bible has led him to finding significant similarities in the teachings of the Scriptures, which he shares in this book.Ejaz Naqvi&nbsp;is chief of Chronic Pain Program and Director of Graduate Medical Education at Kaiser Permanente in the San Francisco East Bay area.&nbsp;He lives in Walnut Creek, CA.&#x201c;<i>The Three Abrahamic Testaments</i> is a unique contribution to interfaith understanding. Written by a committed, believing Muslim scientist and scholar, it offers a helpful and honest comparison of the Qur&#x2019;an with the Hebrew Bible and New Testament that is neither polemical, apologetic nor triumphalist. It acknowledges both similarities and differences in a spirit of improving understanding and respect for the dignity of believers of other faiths. Dr. Ejaz Naqvi does not ignore differences between the Bible and the Qur&#x2019;an, nor does he try to reconcile them. There are various ways to treat differences. Historically, religious thinkers have tended to assume that if there is a discrepancy between scriptures, one scripture must be right and the others are wrong. Based on this simplistic thinking, one religion must therefore hold the key to divine truth while the others are false religions and provide no benefit. Dr. Naqvi provides a deeper and much more spiritual and sophisticated analysis by demonstrating how differences need not be threatening but in fact enlightening. He shows that different versions of the same message appeal to different communities and stimulate discussion so that we can learn to know and respect one another better. From the grand perspective, all three scriptures convey the identical vital concern for ethics, compassion, and the need to respond to the divine will. This book will become a primary tool for interfaith understanding through scriptural reasoning and the comparative study of religious text.&#x201d; <b>&#x2013;Rabbi Reuven Firestone, Regenstein Professor in Medieval Judaism and Islam, Hebrew Union College</b><br><br> &#x201c;At a time of perceived conflict between Muslims and Christians across the globe, Naqvi&#x2019;s book reminds us all of the shared mores and values&#x2015;not to mention myths and stories&#x2015;that bind the Qur&#x2019;an and the Bible together as a single unbroken revelation. This is not just a candid and thought-provoking review of major topics in both the Bible and the Qur&#x2019;an, but also a much-needed corrective to the negativity and conflict that have marred relations between the Abrahamic traditions.&#x201d; <b>&#x2013;Reza Aslan, author of New York Times bestsellers, <i>Zealot</i> and <i>No god but God and Beyond Fundamentalism</i></b><br><br> &#x201c;Once again, Dr. Naqvi separates facts from fiction in this systematic review of the Abrahamic scriptures. As self-interested forces threaten to divide us based on faith, his book is a timely corrective. It debunks the easy accusations that would incriminate religious teachings in the spread of prejudice and hate. As in his first book,&nbsp;The Quran: With or Against the Bible?,&nbsp;the reader is invited to ponder rather than impose received opinion. The book&#x2019;s format is easy to grasp, yet it addresses complex issues, including gender and jihad. The Three Abrahamic Testaments&nbsp;makes a significant contribution to understanding among Jews, Christians and Muslims in our overly polarized world.&#x201d; <b>&#x2013;Michael Wolfe, author of <i>The Hadj: One Thousand Roads to Mecca</i> and <i>Taking Back Islam</i></b><br><br> &#x201c;Open your heart &#x2013; open your mind &#x2013; open this book. The <i>Three Abraham Testaments</i> is a college textbook and bestseller rolled into one. Use it like a coffee table book. Start on any page, savor a kernel and set aside the rest for later. Or read until you are so moved that you must pause to digest. The scriptural references and wisdom quotes are stand-alone gems. The &#x2018;Time to Ponder&#x2019; and &#x2018;Discussion Points for Dialogue and Healing&#x2019; provide ready-made talking points for book groups, classroom settings and conversations over the dinner table. There is no hierarchy in this book except that the Holy One is the Creator and Sustainer of all. By eliminating hierarchy, Dr. Ejaz Naqvi has side-stepped the major competitive questions of &#x2018;whose religion is right&#x2019; and &#x2018;whose religion is best.&#x2019; Instead, he touches upon the essence of all three Abrahamic faiths and the religious streams that spring from them.&#x201d; <b>&#x2013;Rabbi Pamela Frydman, founding rabbi of Or Shalom Jewish Community and author of <i>Calling on God: Sacred Jewish Teachings for Seekers of All Faiths</i></b><br><br> &#x201c;Dr. Naqvi has created another well presented overview of the Abrahamic traditions by exposing us to a greater view of the Qu&#x2019;ran and the Islamic tradition. I highly recommend this resource for congregations as a way to expose their congregants to the comparative teachings of Islam, Christianity and Judaism and to ask, &#x201c;What do you believe?&#x201d; and &#x201c;Why?&#x201d; By starting with what we have in common, we can learn much more than taking a stance of opposition or superiority. Then, invite some Muslim families to come to your congregation to share more about what their lives are like. I know your whole congregation will be enriched.&#x201d; <b>&#x2013;Rev. William McGarvey, Executive Director, Interfaith Council of Contra Costa County, California</b><br><br> &#x201c;It is more than refreshing to probe a book that does not neutralize or sensationalize the difference found in the Abrahamic religious traditions. The Three Abrahamic Testaments is an important contribution to interfaith dialogue and understanding. It provides an inspiring model for how that dialogue might be engaged in a way that is both informative and healing. Dr. Naqvi celebrates the differences while challenging the reader to engage in what is no less than a transformative experience. The discussion and reflective questions found throughout this book invite the reader to become a lively part of the dialogue this book so powerfully presents. We are most grateful for the obvious energy and deep respect Dr. Naqvi displays in this fine work. <b>&#x2013;Rev. Thomas P.

He is, as all men know, a thief, a liar, an occasional murderer, an outrageous braggart, and a man devoid of even the slightest hint of honor.<br><br>Yet of all the men in the world, it is Althalus, unrepentant rogue and scoundrel, who will become the champion of humanity in its desperate struggle against the forces of an ancient god determined to return the universe to nothingness. On his way to steal The Book from the House at the End of the World, Althalus is confronted by a cat--a cat with eyes like emeralds, the voice of a woman, and the powers of a goddess. <br><br>She is Dweia, sister to The Gods and a greater thief even than Althalus. She must be: for in no time at all, she has stolen his heart. And more. She has stolen time itself. For when Althalus leaves the House at the End of the World, much wiser but not a day older than when he'd first entered it, thousands of years have gone by.<br><br>But Dweia is not the only one able to manipulate time. Her evil brother shares the power, and while Dweia has been teaching Althalus the secrets of The Book, the ancient God has been using the dark magic of his own Book to rewrite history. Yet all is not lost. But only if Althalus, still a thief at heart, can bring together a ragtag group of men, women, and children with no reason to trust him or each other.</p><p>"Highly recommended . . .

But then she makes him an offer he can&#x2019;t refuse. She won&#x2019;t open her shop if he buys her inventory. It turns out she is unimaginably wealthy and anxious to dispose of the coins she inherited. Charlotte has a past she wants to forget: kidnapped at 16, she was held captive for four years and subjected to unspeakable things. Eighteen years later, she still rejects God because he didn&#x2019;t save her. Meanwhile, police homicide investigator Ann Silver and Paul Falcon of the FBI, featured in Henderson&#x2019;s Full Disclosure (2012), are investigating a cold case involving a baby boy who was kidnapped and killed.

Overseas, horses were plentiful and Katy spent most of her waking hours riding or reading or writing about horses. The Lord used my horse in Botswana to introduce me to Himself. By the time I graduated from J.E.B. Stuart High School in Falls Church, Virginia, I had attended thirteen different schools and written several books (never published). Katy received a BA in English Literature from George Mason University while training full time as a bicycle racer. She was the silver medallist for Virginia in 1984 and also qualified for the Pan Am Trials. She was offered a long-term substitute teaching position in 1987 in the Marshall Islands (where her Dad was the Ambassador) and accepted it. She returned to the U.S. and attended James Madison University where she received her post-graduate teaching certification in 1990. Horses came back into my life shortly after I married my long time cycling buddy, Chuck Pistole. We lived on Sonrise Farm until the birth of our first child in 1993. Many of Jenny s adventures came from my experiences there. The Pistole s currently own two horses and have had the joy of introducing their own daughter and son to horsemanship. Speaking about her Sonrise Farm books, Katy says, I believe these are God s books. He propelled me downstairs to the computer morning after morning. He has used my love for horses to reveal many misconceptions I had about Him. My passion in life is to allow Him to use these experiences to introduce and encourage children and adults to the grace and love of our incredible Lord.</p><h2>To the Top of the World: Alpine Challenges in the Himalaya and Karakoram</h2><p>As one of the greatest mountaineers of all time, Reinhold Messner is renowned for his quest for ever-fresh challenges in which he seeks to test his abilities and strengths to their limits. <p>This book-the first US edition-is drawn from a selection of Messner's most powerful writing.

Her childhood amour inspired her fantasies and vowed never to forget her&#x2014;even as he left her for a new life in India and a new love.<br><br>Seven years and countless dreams later, Ashley has returned a desolate widower to Bowden Abbey and, true to his promise, to Emily. Yet his heedless proposal of marriage has left her unexpectedly conflicted. Though the heat of passion still burns, Emily fears that it&#x2019;s only a sense of duty&#x2014;not love&#x2014;that has brought him to bended knee. And what is she to make of those seven lost years clouded in secrets too dark for Ashley to share?<br><br>For Emily, her greatest and only love now becomes one worth fighting for, one of startling revelations and second chances, and one, like a melody, too beautiful for words....</p><p>Once again Mary Balogh has written a poignant romance that will be long remembered for its originality and great beauty. In this unusual story, Lady Emily has been deaf and mute since early childhood. She has been cared for and is well loved by a family who nurtures her independence and doesn&#39;t make her feel inadequate because of her disability. Because Emmy&#39;s sister and brother-in-law want her to experience life to its fullest, they assist her in finding a good marriage partner. But Emmy wants to marry for love; she doesn&#39;t want to be a beautiful silent partner to a man who doesn&#39;t care to know who she really is. Unfortunately, the man Emmy loves married another woman long ago. When Ashley arrives from India after eight years as a widow, Emmy finds she loves him too much to accept his proposal. She wants him to marry her for love--not because he feels a sense of responsibility for her.<b>Mary Balogh</b> is the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of more than one-hundred historical novels and novellas including the Edwyn Saga, the Simply Quartet, the Huxtable quintet, and the Survivors' Club novels.

The comforts and challenges of this book are thus as timely as when first published in 1987. With new reflections on the future of Judaism and Israel, Ellis underscores the enduring problem of justice. Ellis' use of liberation theology to make connections between the Holocaust and contemporary communities from the Third World reminds both Jews and oppressed Christians that they share common ground in the experiences of abandonment, suffering, and death. The connections also reveal that Jews and Christians share a common cause in the battle against idolatry--represented now by obsessions for personal affluence, national security, and ethnic survival. According to Ellis, Jews and Christians must never allow the reality of anti-Semitism to become an excuse for evading solidarity with the oppressed peoples--be they African, Asian, Latin American or, especially, Palestinian.</p></p><p><p>MARC H. ELLIS was appointed to the J.M. Dawson Institute of Chruch State Studies at Baylor University in 1998, and was designated in 1999 as both University Professor of American and Jewish Studies and Director of the Center for American and Jewish Studies. He holds an M.A. in American Studies from Florida State University and a Ph.D. in Contemporary Intellectual and Religious Studies from Marquette University. Dr. Ellis is distinguished for his specialization in the areas of Jewish, Christian, and Third World liberation theology, Holocaust and Post-Holocaust theology, and Twentieth-Century Jewish-Christian theology, thought, and dialogue.</p><p>Ellis masterfully uses the central, Jewish story of Exodus and Sinai to call for a contemporary Jewish (and Christian) theology of liberation. He argues against current political policies based on Jewish vulnerability, with the Holocaust as the chief lens, and issues a prophetic call for contemporary Jews to return to the liberation theology embedded in the Exodus, seeking justice for all. In the Israeli-Palestinian context, that requires both sides to "embrace revolutionary forgiveness" as they find ways to come to less-than-ideal but tolerable resolutions of their conflicts, and it requires Americans living in a post-9/11 world to reevaluate their understanding of Muslims and Islam. Whether you agree with Ellis' conclusions or not, you cannot help but be stimulated by his serious and meaningful use of this central Jewish story to understand and respond creatively to some of the most pressing issues of our time.</p> (Rabbi Elliot N. Dorff, Rector and Distinguished Professor of Philosophy, University of Judaism)<br><br><p>This book has assuaged my pain to considerable extent, because it shows, as it has since the first edition, that the voice of prophecy has not been silenced in the Jewish community. We will all be the poorer if that voice is not heeded, but how wonderfully enriched if it is.</p> (Archbishop Desmond Tutu, winner of the Nobel Peace Prize and author of <i>God Has a Dream</i>)<br><br><p>Ellis's narrative belongs alongside those theological narratives that ought to be discussed. This is a vigorous and important work, passionate for justice, rooted in a strong love for his people, and with a deep sensitivity to other human communities.</p> (Gustavo Gutierrez, author of <i>A Theology of Liberation</i>)<br><br><p>Marc Ellis' Jewish Theology of Liberation has already become something of a classic. It is wonderful to have this book in a new and expanded version that covers Marc Ellis' life and prophetic thought up to the present.</p> (Rosemary Radford Ruether, Carpenter Professor of Feminist Theology, Graduate Theological Union)<br><br><p>Marc Ellis has written a book for people who want to think. Challenging our conventional ideas, he forces us to reconsider our assumptions regarding Jewish identity and politics. What emerges is a fascinating and original reconfiguration of some of the most hotly debated political and religious topics today.</p> (Susannah Heschel, Dartmouth College and author of <i>Abraham Geiger and the Jewish Jesus</i>)<br><br><p>Marc Ellis's Toward a Jewish Theology of Liberation is a seminal work. It is not only a brilliant piece of Jewish dissident writing but a moral, impassioned call for reflection and justice that should be read by Jews and non-Jews alike. There is no doubt this book will become the standard among scholars for decades to come.</p> (Sara Roy, Senior Research Scholar, Center for Middle Eastern Studies, Harvard University)</p><h2>Antibodies (The X-files)</h2><p>When a disease-ravaged body is found in the smoldering ruins of the federally funded DyMar genetic research lab, Agents Fox Mulder and Dana Scully fear that a deadly man-made plague is on the loose. As the FBI agents investigating the "X-Files" - cases the bureau has deemed unsolvable - Mulder and Scully pursue the truth wherever it leads, even into the labyrinthine corridors of the FBI ... and beyond.<br>Racing to contain the lethal virus before it can spread, Mulder and Scully make a chilling discovery. Before his death, Dr. David Kennessy, a hotshot cancer researcher at DyMar, had been experimenting with a promising but highly dangerous technology: microscopic bio-machines that can cure any disease, heal any wound. In theory this research could be a miracle cure, perhaps even a doorway to immortality. It was also the only way Dr. Kennessy could save his leukemia-stricken son.<br>But when a second corpse turns up, savagely mutilated from within, it's anything but theoretical. Could machines created to cure have learned to kill? Scrambling for answers, Mulder and Scully are opposed at every step by faceless enemies with all the resources of the government - even perhaps of their own agency - at their command. Enemies who will stop at nothing to ensure that the secret of immortality falls in the right hands - their hands.</p><p>Kevin J.

On a freezing winter afternoon in 1667, she accompanies the magistrate's daughter, Sarah, to the home of a severely injured Quaker man to record his dying words, a common practice of the time. The man, having been trampled by a horse and cart the night before, only has a few hours left to live. Lucy scribbles down the Quaker man's last utterances, but she's unprepared for what he reveals to her&#x2015;that someone deliberately pushed him into the path of the horse, because of a secret he had recently uncovered.</p><p>Fearful that Sarah might be traveling in the company of a murderer, Lucy feels compelled to seek the truth, with the help of the magistrate's son, Adam, and the local constable. But delving into the dead man's background might prove more dangerous than any of them had imagined.</p><p>In <i>The Masque of a Murderer</i>, Susanna Calkins has once again combined finely wrought characters, a richly detailed historical atmosphere, and a tightly-plotted mystery into a compelling read.</p></p><p><p>SUSANNA CALKINS became fascinated with seventeenth-century England while pursuing her doctorate in British history and uses her fiction to explore this chaotic period.

Born in Chicago, he attended Northwestern University and upon graduation went to work for the Associated Press, beginning a lifelong career in journalism that would include long periods at the&nbsp;<i>Chicago Tribune</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Advertising Age</i>.<br> While at the&nbsp;<i>Tribune</i>, Goldsborough began writing mysteries in the voice of Rex Stout, the creator of iconic sleuths Nero Wolfe and Archie Goodwin. Goldsborough&#x2019;s first novel starring Wolfe,&nbsp;<i>Murder in E Minor</i>&nbsp;(1986), was met with acclaim from both critics and devoted fans, winning a Nero Award from the Wolfe Pack. Nine more Wolfe mysteries followed, including&nbsp;<i>Death on Deadline&nbsp;</i>(1987) and&nbsp;<i>Fade to Black</i>&nbsp;(1990). <i>Stop the Presses!</i>&nbsp;(2016) is his most recent novel. &nbsp;Rex Stout's Nero Wolfe is arguably one of the two or three most beloved detectives in fiction, and this fifth volume of Goldsborough's authorized re-creations of the series hero provides yet another opportunity for purists to argue whether he has captured the spirit or merely the form of the originals. This flat and not very mysterious tale will probably support the latter argument. Wolfe and wisecracking Archie Goodwin are hired to find out who is leaking a small advertising agency's secrets to a large and powerful competitor. As is often the case, Wolfe is not terribly interested in the proceedings, not even when the investigation widens to include the murder of a young executive who apparently knew the truth--and he must be constantly cajoled by Archie to keep things moving. All the set pieces involving Wolfe's many idiosyncrasies, the various meals served at his West 35th Street brownstone and irate visits by the irascible Inspector Cramer seem forced, rather than familiar and comfortable, and the classic final gathering of all involved lacks drama and suspense. This one is strictly for fans who can't get enough of the fat man. <br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Jerry Baker&#39;s Old-Time Gardening Wisdom: Lessons Learned from Grandma Putt&#39;s Kitchen Cupboard, Medicine Cabinet, and Garden Shed!

CLUB/THE ONION</p><h2>Hoop Crazy: The Lives of Clair Bee and Chip Hilton (Sport, Culture, and Society)</h2><p>Clair Bee (1896-1983) was a hugely successful basketball coach at Rider College and Long Island University with a 412 and 87 record before his career was derailed in 1951 by a point-shaving scandal. In the trial that sent his star player, Sherman White, to prison, the judge excoriated Bee for creating a morally lax culture that contributed to his players' involvement with gambling. To a certain extent, Bee agreed with the judge's scolding, concluding that coaches, himself included, had become so driven to succeed on the court that they had lost sight of the educational role sports should play. His coaching career effectively over, Bee launched an effort to reform the ills he saw in college sports, and he did so in the pages of the Chip Hilton novels for young readers. He began the series in 1948, but it was the post-scandal books that he used as teaching tools. The books mirrored some of the events of the gambling scandal and were Bee's attempt to reform the problems plaguing college sports. He used his fiction to posit a better sports world that he hoped his young readers would construct and inhabit. The Chip Hilton books were extremely popular and have become a classic series, with over two million copies sold to date. <i>Hoop Crazy</i> is the fascinating story of Clair Bee and his star character Chip Hilton and the ways in which their lives, real and fictional, were intertwined.</p><p>Dennis Gildea, a former sportswriter, is a professor of communications at Springfield College.<p>&#x201c;[T]his book presents a truly unique look at one of the greatest and most controversial college basketball coaches&#x2014;and one of the most popular authors of adolescent sports fiction&#x2014;of all time.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x2014;<i>Journal of Sport History</i>, Spring 2015</p></p><h2>WAR IN PEACE: Conventional and Guerrilla Warfare Since 1945</h2><p>Offers a comprehensive, up-to-date history of world warfare since World War II, detailing the participants, politics, tactics, and weapons of the Korean War, Vietnam, Greek civil war, invasion of Afghanistan, and other conflicts</p><p></p><h2>The Harp Styles of Sonny Terry</h2><p>The music and life of the great blues harp player from the farm in Greensboro, Georgia, his partnership with Brownie McGhee to their rise to fame.

A man at once of his time and outside of it, Blake created a mass of poetry, prose, and visual art that says as much about the religious and political debates of his day as it does about such universal concerns as the power of the human mind and imagination. Seeing himself as both protester and prophet, Blake may have "special relevance" to the contemporary reader, writes Victor Paananen, because of his ability to demonstrate that civilization "is threatened with dissolution only because it fails to heed the Saviour, who is - literally for Blake - within each individual."<br>In this updated version of the author's 1977 edition on the poet, artist, and engraver William Blake, Paananen decodes the mystery of Blake's artistic world and makes clear its relevance to the contemporary reader. Paananen works from the premise that truly understanding even the seemingly simple in Blake's work requires understanding the complex. Such familiar poems as "The Lamb" and "The Tyger" from Songs of Innocence and Experience take on more layers of meaning once Paananen leads the reader through the "bewildering maze" of "visionary Christianity, radical politics, and self-generated myth" that Blake developed so elaborately in his major epic poems - The Four Zoas, Milton, and Jerusalem.<br>In the two decades since the first edition of William Blake appeared, there has been a vast outpouring of criticism, most of it exploring the relationship between Marxist and Blakean thought. Paananen draws on the achievements of recent Marxist critics of Blake and on his own analysis of Blake's thought to show that Blake and Marx shared common philosophic perspectives that arose from their similar views of the thought of their age.</p><p>Victor N. Paananen is Professor of English at Michigan State University.</p><h2>The Twelve Dancing Princesses</h2><p>A picture-book retelling of the Grimm fairy-tale about the king who locked his 12 daughters in their bedroom every night.

Today these magnificent forests have declined to a fraction of their original extent, threatening such species as the gopher tortoise, the red-cockaded woodpecker, and the Venus fly-trap. Conservationists have proclaimed longleaf restoration a major goal, but has it come too late?<br><br>In <i>Looking for Longleaf,</i> Lawrence S. Earley explores the history of these forests and the astonishing biodiversity of the longleaf ecosystem, drawing on extensive research and telling the story through first-person travel accounts and interviews with foresters, ecologists, biologists, botanists, and landowners. For centuries, these vast grass-covered forests provided pasture for large cattle herds, in addition to serving as the world's greatest source of naval stores. They sustained the exploitative turpentine and lumber industries until nearly all of the virgin longleaf had vanished. <br><br><i>Looking for Longleaf</i> demonstrates how, in the twentieth century, forest managers and ecologists struggled to understand the special demands of longleaf and to halt its overall decline. The compelling story Earley tells here offers hope that with continued human commitment, the longleaf pine might not just survive, but once again thrive.<br><br><br><br></p><p>"Easy to digest for a non-technical reader. . . .

It is a stinging satirical novel about the film industry, trifling studio feuds, and the fatuous movie Prater Violet, which, ironically, counterpoints the tragic events on the world stage as Hitler's lengthening shadow falls over the real Vienna of the thirties. At its center are vivid portraits of the mocking genius Friedrich Bergmann, the imperious, dazzlingly witty Austrian director, and his disciple, a genial young screenwriter-the fictionalized Christopher Isherwood. <p>When it first appeared in 1945, Prater Violet caused a fury of critical speculation and acclaim. Edmund Wilson called it "a deliberate historical parable," and Diana Trilling's Nation review said, "Prater Violet is the most charming novel I have read in a long time... It is a book written in the author's own person, yet utterly without ego; it is a novel about movie writers which is yet a novel about the life of every serious artist; it is a book without a political moral, but a profound moral-political statement; it is gay, witty, sophisticated, but wholly responsible."</p></p><p>Christopher Isherwood (1902-86) lived in Berlin from 1928 to 1933 and immigrated to the United States in 1939. Translator, biographer, novelist, and playwright, Isherwood is the author of over twenty books.Christopher Isherwood tells a story that both follows and overlaps the stories of GOODBYE TO BERLIN (best known in the musical adaptation of CABARET). The young novelist is dragooned into working on a film with Friederich Bergman, an Austrian director who draws him into friendship and a new engagement with the world and the politics of Europe in 1933. Paul Boehmer&#39;s reading is, in parts, better than the book, particularly in a passage in which Bergman works out his outrage by acting out parts of the Reichstag fire trial. We still hear Bergman&#39;s voice, but it is Bergman doing impressions of the trial&#39;s principals, and it is a wonderful passage of voice work. Even less well-known Isherwood is interesting, and this rendition of the book is all you could hope for.

An African American of exceptionally light complexion, White went undercover as a young man to expose the depredations of Southern lynch mobs. As executive secretary of the NAACP from 1931 until his death in 1955, White was among the nation&#x2019;s preeminent champions of civil rights, leading influential national campaigns against lynching, segregation in the military, and racism in Hollywood movies.</p><p>White is portrayed here for the first time in his full complexity, a man whose physical appearance enabled him to negotiate two very different worlds in segregated America, yet who saw himself above all as an organization man, &#x201c;Mr. NAACP.&#x201d; Deeply researched and richly documented, White&#x2019;s biography provides a revealing vantage point from which to view the leading political and cultural figures of his time&#x2014;including W.E.B. Du Bois, Eleanor Roosevelt, and James Weldon Johnson&#x2014;and an unrivaled glimpse into the contentious world of civil rights politics and activism in the pre&#x2013;civil rights era.</p><br></p><p>Kenneth Janken is associate professor of Afro-American studies and adjunct professor of history at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. He is the author of <i>Rayford W. Logan and the Dilemma of the African American Intellectual</i> and <i>White: The Biography of Walter White, Mr. NAACP</i> (The New Press).<br>When Walter White died suddenly of a heart attack in March of 1965, the New York Times obituary, taking account of his light skin, straight blond hair, and blue eyes, noted that "White, the nearest approach to a national leader of American Negroes since Booker T. Washington, was a Negro by choice." Indeed, Janken (associate professor of Afro-American studies at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill) finds that when White left Atlanta to work on race violence in the NAACP's New York office in 1918 at the age of 24, he often used his ability to "pass" to his advantage, sometimes even infiltrating white lynch mobs to expose them. This elegantly written and comprehensive biography, the first major work on its subject, is a model of nuanced scholarship and popular history. Janken covers the full sweep of White's career: his complex interactions with the artistic culture of the Harlem Renaissance (he authored several popular novels), his involvement with the NAACP's relationship to the Communist Party, his close working relationship with Eleanor Roosevelt in the attempt to pass congressional anti-lynching laws, his complicated plan to recast in global terms the NAACP's mission during the Cold War. Yet Janken never allows this wealth of detail to become burdensome, moving animatedly through White's life and career, and never hiding the more difficult moments, such as White's fights with W.E.B. DuBois over separatism versus integration, or his "abrasive" (but productive) relationship with a pre-Supreme Court Thurgood Marshall. In sum, this is a multilayered portrait of an important American political figure, who has, until now, been overlooked by historians. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Soap Opera Encyclopedia</h2><p>Gathers synopses for major story lines, cast lists, reviews, and broadcast history for television soap operas, offers profiles of top actors and actresses, and lists Emmy award winners</p><p></p><h2>Zurich Axiom Gunther</h2><p>Offers advice on investment strategy and risk management, clears up common misconceptions about the stock market, and discusses economic forecasts and long-range planning</p><p>Max Gunther was born in England and emigrated to the US when he was 11.

Derek Kidner not only has provided a running commentary on the whole of Proverbs but has also included two helpful study aids. The first is a set of subject guides that pull together teaching scattered throughout the book. The second is a short concordance that helps locate lost sayings (in territory notoriously hard to search) and encourages further subject studies. In short, this volume is a wise person&#39;s guide to wisdom. The original, unrevised text of this volume has been completely retypeset and printed in a larger, more attractive format with the new cover design for the series. These commentaries are designed to help the reader of the Bible understand what the text says and what it means. The Introduction to each book gives a concise but thorough treatment of its authorship, date, original setting and purpose. Following a structural Analysis, the Commentary takes the book section by section, drawing out its main themes, and also comments on individual verses and problems of interpretation. Additional Notes provide fuller discussion of particular difficulties. The goal throughout is to explain the true meaning of the Bible and make its message plain.</p><p>The works of Derek Kidner (MA, Christ's College, Cambridge) are full of the marks of both professor and pastor with his even�handed scholarship as well as his devotional insight. These qualities have made his commentaries in the Tyndale Old Testament Commentary series and The Bible Speaks Today series some of the most beloved and popular of recent decades. Kidner had a long career in both the church and the academy in England. He studied at Cambridge University and then served in the ministry for several years before becoming a senior tutor at Oak Hill Theological College. Kidner began his writing career while serving as warden of Tyndale House in Cambridge from 1964 to 1978, publishing his ninth and final book, <em>The Message of Jeremiah,</em> in 1987."The Tyndale volumes have long been the premier shorter-length commentary series on both Testaments throughout the English-speaking world." (Craig Blomberg, Denver Seminary)<br><br>"Tyndale commentaries are always useful, not least because they focus so clearly on the text of Scripture, and do not fall into the trap of paying too much attention to other commentaries and not enough to the scriptural text they are intended to expound and explain. So they retain their usefulness for preachers, Bible study leaders and for all readers of the Bible." (Peter Adam, principal, Ridley College, Melbourne, Australia)<br><br>"Within its constraints, this series includes some outstanding volumes." (D. A.

When Izzy Chambers finds fiber artist Willow Adams lying in the display window of Izzy's Seaside Knitting Studio, she at first thinks Willow is dead, but Willow, whom she invited to do a demonstration at her shop after meeting the waiflike young woman a year earlier in Boston, is merely asleep. When someone fatally poisons Aidan Peabody, a popular Canary Cove artist, Willow becomes a suspect after the authorities learn she's Aidan's sole beneficiary. Other suspects include a frustrated art teacher, a greedy developer and a gallery owner who was jealous of Aidan's influence with Canary Cove's arts council.

They explain that in Rwanda, refugee children (many of whom have been orphaned) are making pictures of war, while in Kenya, two children race to school, dreaming of one day becoming professional runners. From vast deserts with camels in the North to lush agricultural lands in Central and Southern Africa, the widely varied terrains are described in a paragraph or two of text. Unfortunately, there are no chapter or subtopic headings to indicate immediately what country is being discussed, and there is no indication of where it is located on the continent, so it's difficult to find it on the map. While the art is lively and colorful, and the book concludes with an alphabetical listing of the countries and facts about them, this offering does have its drawbacks.-Daniel Mungai, Queens Borough Public Library, NY</p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p>Ages 6-8. The title says it all. Instead of the "vanishing tribes" view of one Africa with tourists from different countries photographing the animals and primitive people, this informative picture book celebrates the diversity of the 53 nations that make up the continent today. On each page there's a quick vignette of children in one country, with a bright, happy, colorful illustration. Three girls in school uniform walk on Cairo's jammed city sidewalks. A boy in Nigeria practices the ancient Igbo dances. At the back a small note on each country fills in facts about geography, currency, population, etc. There's still the danger of generalization (kids in Kenya running to school), and there are minor inaccuracies (South Africa's Freedom Day dates from 1994, not 1974); but readers will want to go on from here to explore in depth particular countries that interest them. The essential differences and connections are here. <i>Hazel Rochman</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

His father is gone, his mother is spending time with a younger boyfriend, his sister is becoming a teenager and no longer has interest in him. At the same time, Max finds himself capable of startling acts of wildness: he wears a wolf suit, bites his mom, and can&#x2019;t always control his outbursts. During a fight at home, Max flees and runs away into the woods. He finds a boat there, jumps in, and ends up on the open sea, destination unknown. He lands on the island of the Wild Things, and soon he becomes their king. But things get complicated when Max realizes that the Wild Things want as much from him as he wants from them. Funny, dark, and alive, <i>The Wild Things</i> is a timeless and time-tested tale for all ages.<br></p><p>Dave Eggers is the author of <i>What Is the What</i>, among other books.

Max and Stumpy did this often, running and wrestling through the house, though Max's mother and sister, the two other occupants of the home, didn't appreciate the volume and violence of the game. Max's dad lived in the city and phoned on Wednesdays and Sundays but sometimes did not.<br><br>Max lunged toward Stumpy, missed, barreled into the front door, and knocked the doorknob-basket off. The doorknob-basket was a small wicker vessel that Max thought was stupid but Max's mom insisted on having on the front doorknob for good luck. The main thing the basket was good for was getting knocked off, and landing on the floor, where it was often stepped on. So Max knocked the basket off, and then Stumpy stepped on it, putting his foot through the bottom with an unfortunate wicker-ripping sound. Max was worried for a second, but then his worry was eclipsed by the sight of Stumpy trying to walk around the house with a basket stuck to his foot. Max laughed and laughed. Any reasonable person would see the humor in it.<br><br>"Are you going to be a freak all day?" Claire asked, suddenly standing over Max. "You've only been home for ten minutes."<br>His sister Claire was fourteen, almost fifteen, and was no longer interested in Max, not on a consistent basis at least. Claire was a freshman now and the things they always liked to do together - including Wolf and Master, a game Max still thought worthy - were no longer so appealing to her. She had adopted a tone of perpetual dissatisfaction and annoyance with everything Max did, and with most things that existed in the world.<br><br>Max didn't answer Claire's question; any response would be problematic. If he said "No," then it would imply he had been acting freakish, and if he said "Yes" it would mean that not only had he been a freak, and he was admitting it, but that he intended to <i>continue</i> being a freak. <br><br>"You better make yourself scarce," Claire said, repeating one of their dad's favorite expressions. "I'm having people over."<br><br>If Claire had been thinking clearly, she would have known that to tell Max to become <i>scarce</i> would only make him want to be <i>more prominent</i>, and to tell him that she was having people over would only make him more committed to being present. "Is Meika coming?" he asked. Meika was his favorite among Claire's friends, the rest of whom were imbeciles. Meika paid attention to him, actually talked to him, asked him questions, had one time even come into his room to play Legos and admire the wolf suit he kept on his closet door. She had not forgotten what was fun. <br><br>"None of your business," Claire said. "Just leave us alone, okay? Don't ask them to play with your blocks or whatever lame crap you want them to do."<br><br>Max knew that watching and annoying Claire and her friends would be better with someone else, so he went outside, got on his bike, and rode down the street to Clay's. Clay was a new kid; he lived in one of the just-built houses down the street. And though he was pale and his head too big, Max was giving him a chance.<br><br>Max rode down the sidewalk serpentine-style, his head full of possibilities for what he and Clay might do with or, barring that, <i>to</i> Claire's friends. It was December and the snow, dry and powdery just a few days earlier, was now melting, leaving slush on the roads and sidewalks, a patchy cover on the lawns.<br><br>Something was happening in Max's neighborhood. The old houses were being taken down, and in their place, new, bigger and louder houses were rising. There were fourteen homes on his block, and in the last two years, six of them, all of them smallish, one-story ranches, had been leveled. In each case the same thing had happened: the owners had left or had died of old age, and the new owners had decided that they liked the location of the house, but wanted a far larger one where it stood. It brought to the neighborhood the constant sound of construction, and, thankfully for Max, a near-endless supply of castoff materials&#x2014;nails, wood, wire, insulation, and tile. With it all he'd been assembling a sort-of home of his own, in a tree, in the woods by the lake.<br><br>Max pedaled up, dropped his bike, and knocked on the door of Clay Mahoney. He bent down to tie his shoes, and as he finished the second knot on his left shoe, the door flew open.<br><br>"Max" Clay's mother stood over him, wearing tight black pants and a small white T-shirt - TODAY! YES! It said - over a black lycra top; she was dressed like a competitive downhill skier. Behind her, an exercise video had been paused on the television. On the screen, three muscular women were reaching upward and rightward, desperate and grimacing, for something far beyond the frame.<br><br>"Is Clay home?" Max asked, standing up.<br><br>"No, I'm sorry Max, he's not."<br><br>She was holding a large, silver canister with a black handle - some sort of coffee mug - and while taking a sip from it, she looked around the front porch.<br><br>"Are you here alone?" she asked.<br><br>Max thought a second about this question, looking for a second meaning. Of course he was here alone.<br><br>"Yup," he said.<br><br>She had a face, Max had noticed, that always seemed surprised. Her posture and voice aimed at knowingness, but her eyes said <i>Really? What? How is that possible?</i><br><br>"How'd you get here?" she asked.<br><br>Another odd question. Max's bike was lying no more than four feet behind him, in plain sight. Could she not see it?<br><br>"I rode," he said, jerking a thumb over his shoulder.<br><br>"Alone" she asked.<br><br>"Yup," he said. <i>This lady</i>, Max thought.<br><br>"Alone?" she repeated. Her eyes had gone wide. Poor Clay. His mom was nuts. Max knew he should be careful about what he might say to a crazy person. Didn't crazy people need to be treated with great care? He decided to be very polite.<br><br>"Yes, Mrs. Mahoney. I... am... alone." He said the words slowly, carefully, maintaining eye contact all the while. <br><br>"Your parents let you ride around on your own? In December? Without a helmet?"<br><br>This lady definitely had a problem grasping the obvious. It was obvious that Max was alone, and obvious that he had ridden his bike. And there was nothing on his head, so why ask about the helmet? She was delusional on top of it all. Or maybe functionally blind?<br><br>"Yes, Mrs. Mahoney. I don't need a helmet. I live just down the block. I rode here on the sidewalk."<br><br>He pointed down the street to his own house, which was visible from her door. Mrs. Mahoney put her hand on her forehead and squinted, like a castaway searching the horizon for a rescue vessel. She dropped her hand, returned her eyes to Max, and sighed.<br><br>"Well, Clay is at his quilting class," she said. Max didn't know what a quilting class was, but it sounded a lot less fun than making icicle-spears and throwing them at birds, which had been on Max's mind.<br><br>"Well, okay. Thanks, Mrs. Mahoney. Tell him I came by," he said. He waved goodbye to Clay's crazy mom, turned, and got on his bike. He heard the Mahoney's door shut as he coasted away. But when he turned onto the sidewalk and toward his house, he found Mrs. Mahoney next to him, striding purposefully, still holding her silver drink canister.<br><br>"I can't let you go alone," she said, striding briskly alongside him.<br><br>"Thanks, Mrs. Mahoney, but I ride alone every day," he said, pedaling cautiously and again maintaining steady eye contact. Her weirdness had tripled and his heartbeat had doubled.<br><br>"Not today you don't," she said, grabbing for the seat of Max's bike.<br><br>Now he was getting scared. This woman was not only nuts, but she was following him, grabbing at him. He picked up speed. He figured he could ride faster than she could walk, and he intended to do so. He was now standing on his pedals.<br><br>She picked up her pace - still walking! Her elbows were flying left and right, her mouth a quick slash of determination. Was she smiling?<br><br>"Ha!" she giggled. "Fun!"<br><br>It was always the nuttiest people who smiled while doing the nuttiest things. This lady was far gone.<br><br>"Please," he said, now pedaling as fast as he possibly could. He almost hit a mailbox, the Chungs', the one bearing a large peace sign; this had caused great controversy in the neighborhood. "Just let me go," he begged.<br><br>"Don't worry," she huffed, now at a full jog. "I'll be right here the whole way."<br><br>How could he shake her? Would she follow him inside his own house? She was no doubt waiting to get him alone and indoors, so she could do something to him. She could knock him cold with the coffee canister. Or maybe she'd grab a pillow, pin him down, and suffocate him? That seemed more her style. She had the clear-eyed, efficient look of a murderous nurse.<br><br>Now there was barking. Max turned to see that the Scolas' dog had joined them, barking at Mrs. Mahoney and nipping her ankles. Mrs. Mahoney took little notice. Her eyes were bigger than ever. The exertion seemed to make her ever-more gleeful.<br><br>"Endorphins!" she sang. "Thanks, Max!"<br><br>"Please," he said. "What are you gonna do to me?" It was about ten houses until his own.<br><br>"Keep you safe," she said, "from all this."<br><br>She waved her arm around, indicating the neighborhood that Max was born into and in which he'd been raised. It was a quiet street of tall elms and oaks, ending in a cul-de-sac. Beyond the cul-de-sac was a wooded few acres, then the lake. Nothing nefarious or of note had ever happened on this street, or in their town, or, for that matter, within four hundred miles.<br><br>Max swerved suddenly, leaving the sidewalk. He jumped the curb into the road. <br><br>"The road!" Mrs. Mahoney gasped, as if he'd steered his bike into a river of molten lava. The road was empty now and was always empty. But soon she was right behind him, now running, again reaching for his seat.<br><br>Max decided it was silly to go home; that's where she wanted him. He'd be trapped and she'd finish him for sure. His only chance of escape would be the forest.<br><br>He sped up again, giving himself enough room to turn around. He did a quick 180 and headed back toward the dead-end, hoping to make it to the woods.<br><br>"Where are you going?" she wailed.<br><br>Max almost laughed. She wouldn't follow him into the woods, would she? He looked back, and though she'd lost a step or two, it wasn't long before she was sprinting at him. Man, she was fast! He was close to the road's end, almost at the trees.<br><br>"I won't let you out of my sight!" she falsettoed. "Don't worry!"<br><br>He jumped the curb again - eliciting a terrified howl from Mrs. Mahoney - and jumbled over the rough grass and snow. Soon he was quickly ducking under the first low branches of the tall white-mustached pines, weaving between the trunks.<br><br>"MAAAAAX!" she wailed. "Not the woods!"<br><br>He entered the forest and headed toward the ravine.<br><br>"Molesters! Drugs! Homeless! Needles!" she gasped.<br><br>The ravine was up ahead, about twenty feet deep and twelve feet wide. A month earlier, over the gap he'd put a wide bridge of plywood. If he could get to the gap, cross the bridge, and then pull the plank away in time, he might finally be free.<br><br>"Stop!" she yelled.<br><br>He swung his bike underneath him, left and right. He'd never ridden so fast. Even the Scola dog was having trouble keeping up; he was still yapping at the lady's heels.<br><br>"Look out!" she screamed. "The what-do-you-call-it! The gorge!"<br><br>Duh, he thought. He made it to the bridge and again came a howl of incalculable terror. "Nooooooo!"<br><br>He rumbled quickly over the plank. On the other side, he spun out, dropped his bike, and grabbed the plywood. She was almost upon him when he pulled the board free. The bridge fell into the ravine and crashed against the rocks below.<br><br>She stopped short. "Dammit!" she yelled. She stood for a second, hands on hips, heaving. "How do you expect me to protect you when you're all the way over there?"<br><br>Max thought of a few clever answers to this question, but instead said nothing. He mounted his bike again, in case Mrs. Mahoney decided to leap over the gap. She was far stronger and faster than he would have guessed, so he couldn't rule it out.<br><br>At that moment, the Scolas' dog, still running at full speed, chose to pass Mrs. Mahoney, jump over the ravine, and join Max. He flew, effortlessly, and landed on Max's side. He turned back to face her, then looked up to Max with a toothy grin and happy eyes, as if the two of them had together vanquished a common enemy. Max laughed, and when the dog began barking at the woman doubled over on the edge of the ravine, Max barked, too. They both barked and barked and barked.</p><h2>The Calendar of the Soul: A Commentary (Karl K�nig Archive, 7)</h2><p><p>Karl K�nig meditated intensely on the 52 weekly verses of Rudolf Steiner's <em>Calendar of the Soul</em>.

Nancy was sitting at the table with a still-sleepy Missy on her lap. Michael was eating his breakfast in his poised, reflective way. </p><p> Ray tousled Mike's head and leaned over to kiss Missy. Nancy smiled up at him. She was so darn pretty. There were fine lines around those blue eyes, but you'd still never take her for thirty-two. Ray was only a few years older himself, but always felt infinitely her senior. Maybe it was that awful vulnerability. He noticed the traces of red at the roots of her dark hair. A dozen times in the last year he'd wanted to ask her to let it grow out, but hadn't dared. </p><p> "Happy birthday, honey," he said quietly. </p><p> He watched as the color drained from her face. </p><p> Michael looked surprised. "Is it Mommy's birthday? You didn't tell me that." </p><p> Missy sat upright. "Mommy's birthday?" She sounded pleased. </p><p> "Yes," Ray told them. Nancy was staring down at the table. "And tonight we're going to celebrate. Tonight I'm going to bring home a big birthday cake and a present, and we'll have Aunt Dorothy come to dinner. Right, Mommy?" </p><p> "Ray...no." Nancy's voice was low and pleading. </p><p> "Yes. Remember, last year you promised that this year we'd..." </p><p> Celebrate was the wrong word. He couldn't say it. But for a long time he'd known that they would someday have to start changing the pattern of her birthdays. At first she'd withdrawn completely from him and gone around the house or walked the beach like a silent ghost in a world of her own. </p><p> But last year she'd finally begun to talk about them...the two other children. She'd said, "They'd be so big now...ten and eleven. I try to think how they would look now, but can't seem to even imagine....Everything about that time is so blurred. Like a nightmare that I only dreamed." </p><p> "It's supposed to be like that," Ray told her. "Put it all behind you, honey. Don't even wonder what happened anymore." </p><p> The memory strengthened his decision. He bent over Nancy and patted her hair with a gesture that was at once protective and gentle. </p><p> Nancy looked up at him. The appeal on her face changed to uncertainty. "I don't think -- " </p><p> Michael interrupted her. "How old are you, Mommy?" he asked practically. </p><p> Nancy smiled -- a real smile that miraculously eased the tension. "None of your business," she told him. </p><p> Ray took a quick gulp of her coffee. "Good girl," he said. "Tell you what, Mike. I'll pick you up after school this afternoon and we'll go get a present for Mommy. Now I'd better get out of here. Some guy is coming up to see the Hunt place. I want to get the file together." </p><p> "Isn't it rented?" Nancy asked. </p><p> "Yes. That Parrish fellow who's taken the apartment on and off has it again. But he knows we have the right to show it anytime. It's a great spot for a restaurant and wouldn't take much to convert. It'll make a nice commission if I sell it." </p><p> Nancy put Missy down and walked with him to the door. He kissed her lightly and felt her lips tremble under his. How much had he upset her by starting this birthday talk? Some instinct made him want to say, <i>Let's not wait for tonight. I'll stay home and we'll take the kids and go to Boston for the day.</i> </p><p> Instead he got into his car, waved, backed up and drove onto the narrow dirt lane that wound through an acre of woods until it terminated on the cross-Cape road that led to the center of Adams Port and his office. </p><p> Ray was right, Nancy thought as she walked slowly back to the table. There was a time to stop following the patterns of yesterday -- a time to stop remembering and look only to the future. She knew that a part of her was still frozen. She knew that the mind dropped a protective curtain over painful memories -- but it was more than that. </p><p> It was as though her life with Carl were a blur...the entire time. It was hard to remember the faculty house on the campus, Carl's modulated voice...Peter and Lisa. What had they looked like? Dark hair, both of them, like Carl's, and too quiet...too subdued...affected by her uncertainty...and then lost -- both of them. </p><p> "Mommy, why do you look so sad?" Michael gazed at her with Ray's candid expression, spoke with Ray's directness. </p><p> <i>Seven years,</i> Nancy thought. Life was a series of seven-year cycles. Carl used to say that your whole body changed in that time. Every cell renewed itself. It was time for her to really look ahead...to forget. </p><p> She glanced around the large, cheerful kitchen with the old brick fireplace, the wide oak floors, the red curtains and valances that didn't obstruct the view over the harbor. And then she looked at Michael and Missy.... </p><p> "I'm not sad, darling," she said. "I'm really not." </p><p> She scooped Missy up in her arms, feeling the warmth and sweet stickiness of her. "I've been thinking about your present," Missy said. Her long strawberry-blond hair curled around her ears and forehead. People sometimes asked where she got that beautiful hair -- who had been the redhead in the family? </p><p> "Great," Nancy told her. "But think about it outside. You'd better get some fresh air soon. It's supposed to rain later and get very cold." </p><p> After the children were dressed, she helped them on with their windbreakers and hats. "There's my dollar," Michael said with satisfaction as he reached into the breast pocket of his jacket. "I was sure I left it here. Now I can buy you a present." </p><p> "Me has money too." Missy proudly held up a handful of pennies. "Oh, now, you two shouldn't be carrying your money out," Nancy told them. "You'll only lose it. Let me hold it for you." </p><p> Michael shook his head. "If I give it to you, I might forget it when I go shopping with Daddy." </p><p> "I promise I won't let you forget it." </p><p> "My pocket has a zipper. See? I'll keep it in that, and I'll hold Missy's for her." </p><p> "Well..." Nancy shrugged and gave up the discussion. She knew perfectly well that Michael wouldn't lose the dollar. He was like Ray, well organized. "Now, Mike, I'm going to straighten up. You be sure to stay with Missy." </p><p> "Okay," Michael said cheerfully. "Come on, Missy. I'll push you on the swing first." </p><p> Ray had built a swing for the children. It was suspended from a branch of the massive oak tree at the edge of the woods behind their house. </p><p> Nancy pulled Missy's mittens over her hands. They were bright red; fuzzy angora stitching formed a smile face on their backs. "Leave these on," she told her; "otherwise your hands will get cold. It's really getting raw. I'm not even sure you should go out at all." </p><p> "Oh, please!" Missy's lip began to quiver. </p><p> "All right, all right, don't go into the act," Nancy said hastily. "But not more than half an hour." </p><p> She opened the back door and let them out, then shivered as the chilling breeze enveloped her. She closed the door quickly and started up the staircase. The house was an authentic old Cape, and the stairway was almost totally vertical. Ray said that the old settlers must have had a bit of mountain goat in them the way they built their staircases. But Nancy loved everything about this place. </p><p> She could still remember the feeling of peace and welcome it had given her when she'd first seen it, over six years ago. She'd come to the Cape after the conviction had been set aside. The District Attorney hadn't pressed for a new trial because Rob Legler, his vital prosecution witness, had disappeared. </p><p> She'd fled here, completely across the continent -- as far away from California as she could get; as far away from the people she'd known and the place she'd lived and the college and the whole academic community there. She never wanted to see them again -- the friends who had turned out not to be friends but hostile strangers who spoke of "poor Carl" because they blamed his suicide on her too. </p><p> She'd come to Cape Cod because she'd always heard that New Englanders and Cape people were reticent and reserved and wanted nothing to do with strangers, and that was good. She needed a place to hide, to find herself, to sort it all out, to try to think through what had happened, to try to come back to life. </p><p> She'd cut her hair and dyed it sable brown, and that was enough to make her look completely different from the pictures that had front-paged newspapers all over the country during the trial. </p><p> She guessed that only fate could have prompted her to select Ray's real estate office when she went looking for a house to rent. She'd actually made an appointment with another realtor, but on impulse she'd gone in to see him first because she liked his hand-lettered sign and the window boxes that were filled with yellow and champagne mums. </p><p> She had waited until he finished with another client -- a leathery-faced old man with thick, curling hair -- and admired the way Ray advised him to hang on to his property, that he'd find a tenant for the apartment in the house to help carry expenses. </p><p> After the old man left she said, "Maybe I'm here at the right time. I want to rent a house." </p><p> But he wouldn't even show her the old Hunt place. "The Lookout is too big, too lonesome and too drafty for you," he said. "But I just got in a rental on an authentic Cape in excellent condition that's fully furnished. It can even be bought eventually, if you like it. How much room do you need, Miss...Mrs....?" </p><p> "Miss Kiernan," she told him. "Nancy Kiernan." Instinctively she used her mother's maiden name. "Not much, really. I won't be having company or visitors." </p><p> She liked the fact that he didn't pry or even look curious. "The Cape is a good place to come when you want to be by yourself," he said. "You can't be lonesome walking on the beach or watching the sunset or just looking out the window in the morning." </p><p> Then Ray had brought her up here, and immediately she knew that she would stay. The combination family and dining room had been fashioned from the old keeping room that had once been the heart of the house. She loved the rocking chair in front of the fireplace and the way the table was in front of the windows so that it was possible to eat and look down over the harbor and the bay. </p><p> She was able to move in right away, and if Ray wondered why she had absolutely nothing except the two suitcases she'd taken off the bus, he didn't show it. She said that her mother had died and she had sold their home in Ohio and decided to come East. She simply omitted talking about the six years that had lapsed in between. </p><p> That night, for the first time in months, she slept through the night -- a deep, dreamless sleep in which she didn't hear Peter and Lisa calling her; wasn't in the courtroom listening to Carl condemn her. </p><p> That first morning here, she'd made coffee and sat by the window. It had been a clear, brilliant day -- the cloudless sky purple-blue; the bay tranquil and still; the only movement the arc of sea gulls hovering near the fishing boats. </p><p> With her fingers wrapped around the coffee cup, she'd sipped and watched. The warmth of the coffee had flowed through her body. The sunbeams had warmed her face. The tranquillity of the scene enhanced the calming sense of peace that the long, dreamless sleep had begun. </p><p> <i>Peace...give me peace.</i> That had been her prayer during the trial; in prison. <i>Let me learn to accept.</i> Seven years ago... </p><p> Nancy sighed, realizing that she was still standing by the bottom step of the staircase. It was so easy to get lost in remembering. That was why she tried so hard to live each day...not look back or into the future. </p><p> She began to go upstairs slowly. How could there ever be peace for her, knowing that if Rob Legler ever showed up they'd try her again for murder; take her away from Ray and Missy and Michael? For an instant, she dropped her face into her hands. <i>Don't think about it,</i> she told herself. <i>It's no use.</i> </p><p> At the head of the stairs she shook her head determinedly and walked quickly into the master bedroom. She threw open the windows and shivered as the wind blew the curtains back against her. Clouds were starting to form, and the water in the bay had begun to churn with whitecaps. The temperature was dropping rapidly. Nancy was enough of a Cape person now to know that a cold wind like this usually blew in a storm. </p><p> But it really was still clear enough to have the children out. She liked them to have as much fresh air as possible in the morning. After lunch, Missy napped and Michael went to kindergarten. </p><p> She started to pull the sheets from the big double bed and hesitated. Missy had been sniffling yesterday. Should she go down and warn her not to unzip the neck of her jacket? It was one of her favorite tricks. Missy always complained that all her clothes felt too tight at the neck. </p><p> Nancy deliberated an instant, then pulled the sheets completely back and off the bed. Missy had on a turtleneck shirt. Her throat would be covered even if she undid the button. Besides, it would take only ten or fifteen minutes to strip and change the beds and turn on a wash. </p><p> Ten minutes at the most, Nancy promised herself, to quiet the nagging feeling of worry that was insistently telling her to go out to the children <i>now.</i> </p><p> </p><p> Copyright � 1975 by Mary Higgins Clark</p></p><h2>I Ching: Walking your path, creating your future</h2><p><i>I-Ching </i>has been in continuous use for around 3,000 years.

The conflict pitted Athens against a powerful coalition including the preeminent land power of the day, Sparta. Only Athens&#x2019; superior fleet, her &#x2018;wooden walls&#x2019;, by protecting her vital supply routes allowed her to survive. It also allowed the strategic freedom of movement to strike back where she chose, most famously at Sphacteria, where a Spartan force was cut off and forced to surrender.<br><br>Athens&#x2019; initial tactical superiority was demonstrated at the Battle of Chalcis, where her ships literally ran rings round the opposition but this gap closed as her enemies adapted. The great amphibious expedition to Sicily was a watershed, a strategic blunder compounded by tactical errors which brought defeat and irreplaceable losses. Although Athens continued to win victories at sea, at Arginusae for example, her naval strength had been severely weakened while the Spartans built up their fleets with Persian subsidies. It was another naval defeat, at Aegispotomi (405 BC) that finally sealed Athens&#x2019; fate.

Starting with the guitar's electric roots, Part 1 depicts the unique Hawaiian and "Spanish neck" electric models, first developed between 1932 and World War II. Part 2 traces the electric family's growth from 1947 to the 1990s, with the development of the full-depth hollowbody, solidbody, and thinline models. The color photographs are accompanied by descriptive text and detailed captions that identify and date each instrument and describe its technical, aesthetic, and historical significance. Both parts provide historical overviews of the electric guitars of the period followed by in-depth discussions of each manufacturer. Highly recommended for music libraries and research libraries as well as larger public libraries.<br><i>Eric C. Shoaf, Brown Univ. Lib., Providence, </i><br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.The promised companion to last year's lavish <i>Acoustic Guitars and Other Fretted Instruments</i> is another stunner featuring page after page of full-color musical instrument portraits (the pictures are so loving and attentive, you couldn't call them anything else). Gruhn and Carter sort the pictures first into two chronological parts, "Electric Roots: 1932 to World War II" and "Branches of the Electric Family: 1947 to the 1990s," then more finely within each part by type (e.g., Hawaiians and Spanish-necks in part one) and still more finely by maker. Besides the brief, historical main text, they provide for each instrument a generous note, and quite often a distinctive detail of the instrument appears nearby. Practically everyone who cares deeply about America's idiomatic musics--jazz, blues, country, and rock, in each of which the electric guitar and later the electric bass guitar became fundamental voices--will pour over this book like a Hendrix flourish over that morning crowd at the original Woodstock. <i>Ray Olson</i></p><h2>The Sioux Indian Wars, from the Powder River to the Little Big Horn</h2><p>History of 19th century wars between the US and the Sioux nation.Hardcover with jacket,1992</p><p></p><h2>A Child&#39;s War: The German Occupation of Guernsey as Seen Through Young Eyes...

From his first published story &#34;The World Thinker&#34; in 1945 to his final novel Lurulu in 2004, Vance has shown an astonishing range of inventiveness, versatility and sheer storytelling power, as well as a gift for language and world-building second to none. Winner of the Hugo, Nebula, World Fantasy and Edgar awards, his acclaimed first book The Dying Earth and its sequels helped shape the face of modern heroic fantasy for generations of readers -- and writers! In more than sixty novels, he has done more than any other author to define science fantasy and its preeminent form: the planetary adventure. Born in San Francisco in 1916, Vance wrote much of what you&#39;ll find between these covers both abroad and at home in the hills above Oakland, either while serving in the merchant marine or traveling the world with his wife Norma, all the while pursuing his great love of fine cuisine and traditional jazz. Now, at last, the very best of Vance&#39;s mid-length and shorter work has been collected in a single landmark volume. With a Preface by Vance himself and a foreword by long-time Vance reader George R.R. Martin, it stands as the capstone to a splendid career and makes the perfect introduction to a very special writer.</p><p>Encompassing multiple permutations of the planetary romance genre, this best-of collection gathers 18 seminal if sometimes redundant stories and novellas, dating from the 1950s to the 1970s, from SF Grand Master Vance. A brief, illuminating snippet by Vance follows each piece. Novellas include "The Dragon Masters," in which two rivals can't bring themselves to work together when strangers descend from the sky to kill them all, and "The Last Castle," in which slaves revolt and lay siege to the castles of their former masters. Standout stories include "The Moon Moth," the tale of a clueless diplomat who must learn the intricacies of a highly patterned society, and "The Gift of Gab," in which men discover a strange intelligence while mining the bounty of off-world seas. Though the dearth of significant female characters makes the collection feel dated, Vance's stylistic bravado and lush, baroque prose create compelling worlds that blur the line between fantasy and far-flung future-world SF. Vance has won Hugo, Nebula, World Fantasy and Edgar awards. <i>(Jan.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.Now in the twilight of a career spanning back to the 1940s, Vance is a legend among his colleagues, many of whom look to the Grandmaster's works for invaluable tips on literary style and character development. Here, editors Dowling and Strahan offer the commendable results of poring through Vance's prodigious oeuvre and selecting stories to showcase his best work and feature some of his most cherished recurring protagonists. "The Overworld" and "The Sorcerer Pharesm," for instance, star bumbling rogue Cugel the Clever, a stalwart of Vance's many Dying Earth tales set on a far-future Earth bereft of science and seduced by magic. Vance's prowess with hard sf is on display with "Sail 25," about a fleet of starships driven by sun-sails, and his mastery of fantasy comes through in "The Miracle Workers," a nontraditional swords-and-sorcery yarn. With an introduction by George Martin and insightful afterwords to each piece by Vance himself, this is a celebration for his fans, an ideal introduction for new readers of his work. <i>Carl Hays</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

In the 1970s David began researching ice-cream. It was an innocent enough idea, but she got side-tracked--the result was 20 years of research into the whole history of ice and ice-making, and this book, which she died before completing (it has been finished by Jill Norman). As revealed in extracts from the earliest writings on the subject, ice, before the days of refrigeration, was an item prized by the mightiest and warmest empires. Though not a cookbook, this encyclopedic treatise on ice won a 1995 Julia Child Cookbook Award for Literary Food Writing, and a Jane Grigson Award.Elizabeth David (1913-1992) was one of the most successful food writers of the twentieth century. She discovered her taste for good food and wine when, as a student at the Sorbonne, she lived with a French family for two years. After returning to England she made up her mind to learn to cook, so that that she could reproduce for herself and her friends some of the food that she had come to appreciate in France. Subsequently she lived in France, Italy, Greece, Egypt and India, learning and writing about the local dishes and cooking them in her own kitchen. Her first book, Mediterranean Food, signalled the start of a dazzling writing career, and was followed by many others, now considered classics, such as French Country Cooking,&#34; &#34;and Italian Food.&#34; &#34;The publication of French Provincial Cooking in 1960 confirmed her position as the most inspirational and influential cookery writer in the English language, and she was the recipient of many awards.Elizabeth David was also interested in the literature of cookery, and at the time of her death she was working on a study of the use of ice, the ice-trade and the early days of refrigeration, published posthumously as Harvest of the Cold Months.</p><h2>Mexican Masks and Puppets: Master Carvers of the Sierra de Puebla</h2><p>In the Mexican states of Puebla and Veracruz, old masked dances have survived in isolated mountain regions. These dances include wonderful masks of humans and animals, masks with beautiful, comic, or wicked faces. Created by Indigenous master carvers, mascareros, these masks and puppets appear during religious fiestas. Over 700 vivid color photos reveal these masks and puppets in all their glory. The thoroughly researched text answers the questions about who made these beautiful works of art, who these dance characters are, and the nature of the religion they represent. The Spanish conquerors strove to convert the Indian inhabitants of Mexico to Christianity. However, these converts secretly retained important deities from earlier times to accompany Christian elements, creating a poetic blend of beliefs. Given that these indigenous peoples have suffered many injustices, the masks, puppets, and dance dramas reflect many unresolved societal tensions along with veiled wishes for divine justice.</p><p>Bryan J. Stevens began to collect Mexican masks in 1987, initially because these masks were so visually attractive. Researching these masks made them seem more vivid and underscored the talents of their carvers. He and his wife, Lucy, live in York, Pennsylvania.</p><h2>NIV, Beautiful Word Bible, Hardcover: 500 Full-Color Illustrated Verses</h2><p><p><strong>Be drawn into God&#x2019;s Word through a fresh, creative expression of the beautiful words of Scripture.</strong></p><p>Crafted on high-quality paper and balanced with inspiring full-color art and blank space for your own drawings and journaling, the&nbsp;<em>NIV Beautiful WordTM&nbsp;Bible</em>&nbsp;will encourage a deeper and more authentic quiet time.

But to worship the man, they need an image of him as a god, and no one has ever seen him. So the high priests send a limbless master painter named Tibor McMasters into the wilderness on a mission to find Lufteufel and capture his likeness. Unfortunately for Tibor, the nation&#x2019;s remaining Christians do not want him to succeed and are willing to kill to ensure that the so-called Deus Irae remains hidden. This hallucinatory tale through a nuclear wasteland asks what price the artist must pay for art and tries to figure out just what makes a god. &nbsp;<p></p><p>PHILIP K.

Full color.</p><p>Mother-love is profound, however a baby comes into a woman's life. For Rose Lewis, the journey to motherhood begins with a letter to Chinese officials, asking if she can adopt from the "big room with lots of other babies." The infants in that room in China are each missing a mother, but Lewis is missing something, too--a baby. She travels to China to meet her new little girl and falls head over heels in love. Taking her baby home to America, Lewis introduces her to all her family and friends, and they begin their life together. <p> A touching love story, <i>I Love You Like Crazy Cakes</i> will warm the cockles of any new parent's heart, especially those who have recently adopted a child.

Here, once again, in five stories, is Hasek&#39;s immortal soldier who has endeared himself to readers the world over: Svejk, the good-hearted conscript, enmeshed in red tape, who does everything wrong and is still more than a match for the officers who have to deal with him. Here too are stories that confirm Hasek&#39;s reputation as a brilliant satirist; delightfully funny stories of irrational bureaucracy in an age of world war, revolution, and Bolshevism; and nostalgically mellow stories of the everyday comedy of life in the old, ramshackle Austro-Hungarian Empire--the irreverent humour, fears, hopes and escapades. Readers will be happy to discover that in The Red Commisar Hasek&#39;s originality and wit live on beside new and unexpected facets of his craft.&#34;</p><p>Cecil Parrott, translator, biographer and unrivalled authority on Jaroslav Hasek (1883-1923), describes him succinctly: &#39;Truant, rebel, vagabond, anarchist, play-actor, practical joker, bohemian (and Bohemian), alcoholic, traitor to the Czech legion, Bolshevik and bigamist.&#39; He was also a satirical writer of genius, best known for The Good Soldier Svejk, but, as The Red Commissar (reissued in Faber Finds) reveals, dazzling in other formats as well: feuilletons, sketches, short stories and satirical cameos. Sir Cecil Parrott (1909-1984), diplomat, translator, writer and scholar, is best known for his definitive translation of Jaroslav Hasek&#39;s The Good Soldier Svejk. He also wrote two autobiographical volumes, The Tightrope and The Serpent and the Nightingale as well as his biography of Jaroslav Hasek, The Bad Bohemian (reissued in Faber Finds as is his translation of some of Hasek&#39;s short stories, The Red Commissar)). His diplomatic career culminated with his posting to Prague where he was the British Ambassador from 1960 to 1966. On retiring from the Foreign Office, he became first Professor of Russian and Soviet Studies and later Professor of Central and South-Eastern European Studies and Director of the Comenius Centre at the University of Lancaster.Text: English, Czech (translation)</p><h2>Soviet Strategic Aviation in the Cold War</h2><p>Born in the 1930s, the Soviet Air Force's long-range bomber arm (known initially as the ADD and later as the DA) proved itself during World War II and continued to develop in the immediate post-war years, when the former allies turned Cold War opponents. When the strategic bomber Tu-4 was found to be too 'short-legged' to deliver strikes against the main potential adversary - the USA, both Tupolev and Myasishchev OKBs began the task by creating turbine-engined strategic bombers. By the Khrushchev era in the mid/late 1950's the Soviet defense industry and aircraft design bureau set about adapting the bombers to take air-launched missiles for use against land and sea targets. In 1962 the DA fielded its first supersonic aircraft - the Tu-22 Blinder twinjet, which came in pure bomber and missile strike versions. The Brezhnev years saw a resurgence of strategic aviation with the Tu-22M Backfire 'swing-wing' supersonic medium bomber entering service in the mid-1970s followed in 1984 by the Tu-95MS Bear-H and Tu-160 Blackjack which were capable of carrying six and 12 air-launched cruise missiles respectively. <i>Soviet Strategic Aviation in the Cold War</i> shows how the DA's order of battle changed in the period from 1945 to 1991. Major operations including the air arm's involvement in the Afghan War, the Cold War exercises over international waters in the vicinity of the 'potential adversary', and the shadowing of NATO warships are covered together with details of Air Armies, bomber divisions and bomber regiments, including their aircraft on a type-by-type basis. More than 500 photos, most of which are previously unpublished in the West, are supplemented by 61 color profiles, color badges, and line drawings of the aircraft and their weapons, making this an essential reference source for the historian and modeler alike.</p><p>Yefim Gordon is one of Russia&#39;s leading aviation writers and publishers. He is the author of many books on Soviet aviation and currently lives in Moscow."It is a book I am positive you will very much enjoy reading and belongs on the shelves of any student of Soviet military aviation and long range bombers.

Ultimately, it is the perceived health of the economy which determines how much we can spend on our schools, highways, and defense; economists decide<b> </b>how much unemployment is acceptable and whether it is right to print money or bail out profligate banks.&nbsp;<br><br> The backlash we are currently witnessing suggests that people are turning against the experts and their faulty understanding of our lives. Despite decades of steady economic growth, many citizens feel more pessimistic than ever, and are voting for candidates who voice undisguised contempt for the technocratic elite. For too long, economics has relied on a language which fails to resonate with people's actual experience, and we are now living with the consequences.<br><br> In this powerful, incisive book, David Pilling reveals the hidden biases of economic orthodoxy and explores the alternatives to GDP, from measures of wealth, equality, and sustainability to measures of subjective wellbeing. Authoritative, provocative, and eye-opening,&nbsp;<i>The Growth Delusion</i>&nbsp;offers witty and unexpected insights into how our society can respond to the needs of real people instead of pursuing growth at any cost.</p><p><b>David Pilling&nbsp;</b>is an associate editor at&nbsp;<i>The Financial Times</i>, where he has reported on business, economics, and politics from London, Chile, Argentina, Tokyo, and Hong Kong. He is currently the Africa editor, based in London.1<br><br>Kuznets&#x2019;s Monster<br><br>For most of human history the workings of what we casually refer to as &#x201c;the economy&#x201d; were pretty much a black box. Indeed, for millennia the concept of an economy hardly existed at all. There were at least two reasons for this. First, before the eighteenth-century Industrial Revolution, there was really no such thing as economic growth. That made the economy an awful lot duller. The output of agricultural societies was pretty much a function of the weather. If rains were good, the harvest was good. If not, it wasn&#x2019;t. Nor, in this pre-industrial world, were there huge productivity gaps between one region and another. Most people were just scraping by. Thus the size of a region&#x2019;s economy was largely determined by the size of its population. In ad 1000 China and India accounted for just over half of global economic output, a proportion that remained unchanged for 600 years (and may be heading that way again).<br><br>Second, in an era of monarchs&#x2014;especially those lucky enough to have been ordained by God&#x2014;what was going on in the broader economy was of no great concern. For an absolute monarch there was no distinction between his own wealth and that of his realm. Given the lack of distinction between the wealth of the monarch and the wealth of the nation, there was little room for anything we might call an economy. Apart from keeping the court in its accustomed luxury, the only thing required of a national economy was to finance war. A nation grew only if it conquered new dominions. If the king could muster armies to grab new territory, the national weal would be increased. But how could you tell whether your nation could bear the cost? Most early attempts to catalogue the size of an economy were driven by the need to work out the monarch&#x2019;s capacity to wage war.<br><br>So it was in France. In 1781 Jacques Necker, the Swiss finance minister of Louis XVI, presented his famous compte rendu au roi, his &#x201c;report to the king,&#x201d; the first attempt to take serious stock of France&#x2019;s finances. Necker, formerly a wildly successful banker&#x2014;are the alarm bells going off yet?&#x2014;showed that France&#x2019;s finances were in rude health. Revenues were said to exceed expenditure by the enormous sum of 10 million livres. The main purpose of the report was to demonstrate that France could easily afford its involvement in the American Revolutionary War, in which, as was customary, it found itself on the opposite side to Britain. Necker, who had made his own fortune through speculation, wanted to prove that France&#x2019;s finances were so solid it could easily borrow money to finance its war effort. What the compte rendu cleverly omitted, however, was that France had already borrowed heavily under Necker&#x2019;s own direction. One of the earliest attempts to present a set of national accounts was also a piece of fiction.<br><br>Necker&#x2019;s stab at national accounting was not the first. That distinction is usually given to William Petty, whose publication of the Down Survey in 1652 is considered by many to be the first systematic effort to survey a country&#x2019;s economy&#x2014;in this case, that of Ireland. With the help of simple instruments and a thousand unemployed soldiers, Petty undertook the comprehensive mapping of land in thirty counties covering 5 million acres. The principal motivation was to carve up Catholic land conquered by Oliver Cromwell during the Civil War and to use it to pay back those who had financed the war as well as the arrears of soldiers&#x2019; wages. In addition to mapping the land, Petty conducted a fairly rigorous survey of assets, including ships, houses, and personal estates. From this he worked out flows of income that would be generated, a crucial distinction from earlier efforts to catalogue stocks of wealth such as the Domesday Book of 1086.<br><br>Later, after the restoration of King Charles II, Petty did the same in England and Wales. This time the objective was to improve the monarch&#x2019;s capacity to tax his subjects. Petty recommended keeping records on domestic consumption, production, trade, and population growth and started to develop methods for assessing the value of labor as well as land.<br><br>If early attempts to survey the economy had common themes of war, taxation, and subservience to the monarch&#x2019;s needs, there were other schools of thought pulling in a different direction. In France in the eighteenth century the so-called physiocrats emphasized that the wealth of a nation was rooted in farm production and productive work. Subtly different from Petty, in the physiocrats&#x2019; interpretation the &#x201c;productive class&#x201d; consisted of mainly agricultural laborers, while the so-called &#x201c;sterile&#x201d; class included &#x201c;artisans, professionals, merchants and, lo and behold, the King himself.&#x201d; Viewed from this perspective, the invention of the economy&#x2014;as something distinct from the monarch&#x2014;was a profoundly democratic act.<br><br>Adam Smith, in his An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations, first published in 1776, also divided labor into productive and unproductive categories. A man, he wrote, &#x201c;grows rich by employing a multitude of manufacturers: He grows poor by maintaining a multitude of menial servants.&#x201d; It wasn&#x2019;t a very flattering view of the leisured classes. Along with hosts of servants performing useless tasks for do-nothing aristocrats, Smith put the monarch, as well as the army and the navy, into the category of unproductive labor.<br><br>What unites these early attempts to catalogue national wealth is an effort to draw what economists today call the production boundary&#x2014;between activities that should be counted and those that should not. In short, they were trying to answer a question that is still relevant today: precisely what is an economy? In the great economic ledger should the king appear on the plus side, the embodiment in flesh and blood of the national patrimony? Or, as the physiocrats and Adam Smith implied, should he be on the negative side of the ledger, an unproductive spender of the nation&#x2019;s resources?<br><br>The same question of what should be included and what should be excluded has rumbled on ever since. Should we include government spending? How about providers of services, whose contributions to society&#x2014;healthy minds (psychoanalysts), humor (clowns), education (teachers)&#x2014;may be harder to count than horseshoes or bushels of wheat? In the twentieth century communist countries largely ignored services altogether. Even today we struggle to measure their economic contribution.<br><br>Modern national accounts of the type used by virtually every country in the world today only really began to take shape in the 1930s. Simon Kuznets is usually credited with the invention of GDP, the quintessence of the national accounting system. But Kuznets, rather like Victor Frankenstein, soon saw his creation take on a life&#x2014;and a direction&#x2014;of its own.<br><br>The man who is said to have invented our way of measuring growth was born in 1901 into a merchant family in the town of Pinsk in what was then part of the Russian empire. Pinsk had a large Jewish population and Kuznets&#x2019;s parents were Belarusian Jews. As a child he lived under the rule of the tsar, and as an adolescent sympathized with the Mensheviks, whose hopes of reforming tsarist Russia were swept aside by the Bolshevik revolution of October 1917. Kuznets then studied at Kharkiv University in Ukraine, where he attended the Institute of Commerce and studied economics, history, statistics, and mathematics. He was a young man of great social conscience and ideals.<br><br>His tutors at Kharkiv stressed the importance of basing opinions on empirical data, a lesson that stayed with him for life. There was also an emphasis on placing economic theory in a wider historical and social context. Kuznets was a brilliant student and by his early twenties had published his first paper on the wages of factory workers in Kharkiv. His studies at the university were interrupted by the Russian civil war, and in 1922 the family fled, via Turkey, to the US. It was here that the Belarusian �migr� was to make a profound and lasting impact on global economics.<br><br>Kuznets continued his education at Columbia University, graduating in 1923 and receiving his PhD in 1926. The following year he joined the National Bureau of Economic Research, a think tank founded in 1920. Kuznets would become a distinguished academic economist with something any self-respecting economist aspires to&#x2014;a curve named after him. (Oh, and he also won a Nobel Prize in economics in 1971.) His most lasting achievement, however, came in the intersection between economics and the real world.<br><br>Kuznets loved data. He worked closely with the first director of research at the National Bureau of Economic Research, Wesley Mitchell, who was also chairman of President Herbert Hoover&#x2019;s Committee on Social Trends. That work took Kuznets into the heart of government policy. Hoover&#x2019;s election campaign had promised Americans &#x201c;a chicken in every pot and a car in every garage.&#x201d; What they got instead was the Wall Street Crash and the Great Depression. Hoover&#x2019;s response to the terrible depression that followed, which at its trough saw at least one in every four Americans without work, was slow and inadequate. Essentially, he thought the economy would heal itself. Prosperity, he assured Americans, was just around the corner.<br><br>Hoover may not have been entirely to blame. There was no systematic methodology for drawing up an accurate picture of a national economy. A publication in 2000 by the US Department of Commerce, which praised GDP as &#x201c;one of the great inventions of the 20th century,&#x201d; quotes an economist as saying, &#x201c;One reads with dismay of Presidents Hoover and then Roosevelt designing policies to combat the Great Depression of the 1930s on the basis of such sketchy data as stock price indices, freight-car loadings and incomplete indices of industrial production.&#x201d; As hard as it is to believe now in this age of obsession with economic statistics, Hoover had only the crudest notion of what was actually going on.<br><br>That was about to change. When Franklin D. Roosevelt became president in 1933, Kuznets was entrusted with the task of creating national accounts. Kuznets outlined his ideas in an article for the Encyclopedia of Social Sciences. His notion was disarmingly simple: to squeeze all human activity into a single number.<br><br>Kuznets was the ideal man for the job. He had a near-obsession with measuring things. One writer compares his way of analyzing an economy to a doctor on his patient rounds. He based his assessment on observable data and symptoms. But understanding the patient&#x2019;s underlying condition also required judgment, knowledge, and a rigorous inquisition of the facts. For Kuznets, being thorough was more important than being brilliant.<br><br>Kuznets began by categorizing American industry into different sectors, such as energy, manufacturing, mining, and agriculture. He was given a staff of three assistants and five statistical clerks. &#x201c;Together they hit the road, visiting factories, mines and farms, interviewing owners and managers and writing down figures in notebooks.&#x201d; Although the scale of data collection is vastly bigger these days, survey-based methodology hasn&#x2019;t changed that much even in the era of big data. To this day sizing up an economy remains primarily an extrapolation of survey data, not a summation of gathered facts.<br><br>Kuznets&#x2019;s team traveled the length and breadth of the USA asking farmers and factory managers what and how much they had produced and what they had purchased in order to make their final product. The team shared data so they could compare results and iron out anomalies. Kuznets knew the data were more or less meaningless in isolation. They had to be interpreted. Though it would take many more years before the first publication, in 1942, of a full set of gross national product statistics, Kuznets&#x2019;s work bore much earlier fruit. In January 1934 he presented his first report to Congress. It ran to 261 pages and, for such a historic document, bore a name that only an economist could dream up: National Income, 1929&#x2013;32.<br><br>The report began with much throat clearing about what the numbers could and could not reveal. His effort was, Kuznets said, &#x201c;an amalgam of . . . estimates,&#x201d; at best &#x201c;only well-considered guesses.&#x201d; The welfare of a nation, he made clear, could &#x201c;scarcely be inferred&#x201d; from such an estimate. Contained within its pages, however, was a bombshell. In the three years following the Wall Street Crash the American economy had almost halved in size.<br><br>Kuznets&#x2019;s findings became the basis for the second, much more ambitious, phase of Roosevelt&#x2019;s New Deal, in which the government spent massively on public works, farm aid, and social security in order to pull the US economy out of its seemingly interminable recession. Kuznets had provided a more rigorous empirical foundation on which to take such radical action than freight-car loadings. Still, he had warned that the estimates of national income were &#x201c;of little value in themselves.&#x201d; The headline number was not what was important, he said in words that should ring louder than ever today. For example, closer analysis showed that inequality had increased greatly during the Great Depression. Blue-collar wages had fallen much faster than white-collar salaries, and property owners had fared better than most. These findings provided Roosevelt with the evidence he needed to push through his radical employment policies, which included unemployment relief, the banning of child labor, and the right of labor unions to organize. Without Kuznets&#x2019;s report, much of this would have been impossible.<br><br>His work was far from finished. In 1936 Kuznets helped organize the first Conference on Research in Income and Wealth with high-level participants from both academia and government. It was during this conference that the term gross national product, or GNP, was first used. The proceedings of the first three annual conferences were published, revealing sharp differences among participants about what should be measured and what should be left out.<br><br>Although Kuznets is considered the father of GDP, in several important respects the methodology that evolved by the early 1940s&#x2014;and which has remained largely in use ever since&#x2014;went against his most profoundly held beliefs. Kuznets was striving for a measure that would reflect welfare rather than what he considered a crude summation of all activity. He wanted to exclude illegal activities, socially harmful industries and most government spending. On many of these issues he lost. One student of national accounting goes so far as to suggest, &#x201c;Kuznets, far from being the progenitor of GDP, was its biggest opponent.&#x201d;<br><br>One of the most important consequences of the Second World War was the invention of the atomic bomb. It was developed by scientists, some of whom had fled Nazi Germany, working on the top-secret Manhattan Project in the New Mexico desert. The bomb was not only an outcome of the war; it also helped win it. Less well known is the case of GDP, the invention of which was hastened and molded by the life-and-death struggle with fascism. As with the atomic bomb, its invention had a material impact on the war. Like some of those who led the Manhattan Project, Kuznets was also a reluctant participant in his own creation.<br><br>Kuznets thought that a sensible definition of the economy should exclude defense spending. During the war he bent to pressure to include expenditure on armaments to defeat fascism, but in peacetime, he argued, a country&#x2019;s ability to wage war did not contribute to people&#x2019;s welfare. National income statements, he wrote in 1937, should be constructed from the viewpoint of an &#x201c;enlightened social philosophy&#x201d; and should discount activities that were detrimental or, in his word, a &#x201c;disservice.&#x201d; The first item he li...</p><h2>Ultimate Nordic Pole Walking Book</h2><p>This is the ultimate guide to Nordic pole walking.

Cronin is a remarkable storyteller (just ask adoring fans of his award-winning <em>Mary and O'Neil</em>), whose gorgeous writing brings depth and vitality to this ambitious epic about a virus that nearly destroys the world, and a six-year-old girl who holds the key to bringing it back. <em>The Passage</em> takes readers on a journey from the early days of the virus to the aftermath of the destruction, where packs of hungry infected scour the razed, charred cities looking for food, and the survivors eke out a bleak, brutal existence shadowed by fear. Cronin doesn't shy away from identifying his "virals" as vampires. But, these are not sexy, angsty vampires (you won&#x2019;t be seeing "Team Babcock" t-shirts any time soon), and they are not old-school, evil Nosferatus, either. These are a creation all Cronin's own--hairless, insectile, glow-in-the-dark mutations who are inextricably linked to their makers and the one girl who could destroy them all. A huge departure from Cronin's first two novels, <em>The Passage</em> is a grand mashup of literary and supernatural, a stunning beginning to a trilogy that is sure to dazzle readers of both genres. --<em>Daphne Durham</em></p> <strong>Dan Chaon Reviews <em>The Passage</em></strong> <p><b>Dan Chaon is the acclaimed author of the national bestseller <em>Await Your Reply</em> and <em>You Remind Me of Me</em>, which was named one of the best books of the year by <em>The Washington Post</em>, <em>Chicago Tribune</em>, <em>San Francisco Chronicle</em>, <em>The Christian Science Monitor</em>, and <em>Entertainment Weekly</em>, among other publications. Chaon lives in Cleveland Heights, Ohio, and teaches at Oberlin College. Read his review of <em>The Passage</em>:</b></p> <p> </p> <p>There is a particular kind of reading experience--the feeling you get when you can&#x2019;t wait to find out what happens next, you can&#x2019;t turn the pages fast enough, and yet at the same time you are so engaged in the world of the story and the characters, you don&#x2019;t want it to end. It&#x2019;s a rare and complex feeling--that plot urgency pulling you forward, that yearning for more holding you back. We say that we are swept up, that we are taken away. Perhaps this effect is one of the true magic tricks that literature can offer to us, and yet it doesn&#x2019;t happen very often. Mostly, I think, we remember this experience from a few of the beloved books of our childhood.</p> <p>About three-quarters of the way through <em>The Passage</em>, I found myself in the grip of that peculiar and intense readerly emotion. One part of my brain couldn&#x2019;t wait to get to the next big revelation, and I found myself wanting to leapfrog from paragraph to paragraph, hurtling toward each looming climax. Meanwhile, another part of my brain was watching the dwindling final pages with dread, knowing that things would be over soon, and wishing to linger with each sentence and character a little while longer.</p> <p>Finishing <em>The Passage</em> for the first time, I didn&#x2019;t bother to put it on a shelf, because I knew I would be flipping back through its pages again the next day. Rereading. Considering. </p> <p>Certain kinds of books draw us into the lives of their characters, into their inner thoughts, to the extent that we seem to know them, as well as we know real people. Readers of Justin Cronin&#x2019;s earlier books, <em>Mary and O&#x2019;Neil</em> and <em>The Summer Guest</em>, will recognize him as an extraordinarily insightful chronicler of the ways in which people maneuver through the past, and through loss, grief and love. Though <em>The Passage</em> is a different sort of book, Cronin hasn&#x2019;t lost his skill for creating deeply moving character portraits. Throughout, in moments both large and small, readers will find the kind of complicated and heartfelt relationships that Cronin has made his specialty. Though the cast of characters is large, they are never mere pawns. The individual lives are brought to us with a vivid tenderness, and at the center of the story is not only vampires and gun battles but also quite simply a quiet meditation on the love of a man for his adopted daughter. As a fan of Cronin&#x2019;s earlier work, I found it exciting to see him developing these thoughtful character studies in an entirely different context.</p> <p>There are also certain kinds of books expand outwards beyond the borders of their covers. They make us wish for encyclopedias and maps, genealogies and indexes, appendixes that detail the adventures of the minor characters we loved but only briefly glimpsed. <em>The Passage</em> is that kind of book, too. There is a dense web of mythology and mystery that roots itself into your brain--even as you are turning the pages as quickly as you can. Complex secrets and untold stories peer out from the edges of the plot in a way that fires the imagination, so that the world of the novel seems to extend outwards, a whole universe--parts of which we glimpse in great detail--and yet we long to know even more. I hope it won&#x2019;t be saying too much to say that there are actually two universes in this novel, one overlapping the other: there is the world before the virus, and the world after, and one of the pleasures of the book is the way that those two worlds play off one another, each one twisting off into a garden of forking and intertwined paths. I think, for example, of the scientist Jonas Lear, and his journey to a fabled site in the jungles of Bolivia where clouds of bats descend upon his team of researchers; or the little girl, Amy, whose trip to the zoo sets the animals into a frenzy--"They know what I am," she says; or one of the men in Dr. Lear&#x2019;s experiment, Subject Zero, monitored in his cell as he hangs "like some kind of giant insect in the shadows." These characters and images weave their way through the story in different forms, recurring like icons, and there are threads to be connected, and threads we cannot quite connect--yet. And I hope that there will be some questions that will not be solved at all, that will just exist, as the universe of <em>The Passage</em> takes on a strange, uncanny life of its own. </p> <p>It takes two different kinds of books to work a reader up into that hypnotic, swept away feeling. The author needs to create both a deep intimacy with the characters, and an expansive, strange-but-familiar universe that we can be immersed in. <em>The Passage</em> is one of those rare books that has both these elements. I envy those readers who are about to experience it for the first time. </p> <p><strong>Danielle Trussoni Reviews <em>The Passage</em></strong></p> <p><b>Danielle Trussoni is the author of <em>Falling Through the Earth: A Memoir</em>, which was the recipient of the 2006 Michener-Copernicus Society of America Award, a BookSense pick, and one of <em>The New York Times</em> Ten Best Books of 2006.

Read her review of <em>The Passage</em>:</b></p> <p> </p> <p>Justin Cronin&#x2019;s <em>The Passage</em> is a dark morality tale of just how frightening things can become when humanity transgresses the laws of nature.</p> <p>The author of two previous novels, Cronin, in his third book, imagines the catastrophic possibilities of a vampiric bat virus unleashed upon the world. Discovered by the U.S. Military in South America, the virus is transported to a laboratory in the Colorado mountains where it is engineered to create a more invincible soldier. The virus&#x2019; potential benefits are profound: it has the power to make human beings immortal and indestructible. Yet, like Prometheus&#x2019; theft of fire from the Gods, knowledge and technological advancement are gained at great price: After the introduction of the virus into the human blood pool, it becomes clear that there will be hell to pay. The guinea pigs of the NOAH experiment, twelve men condemned to die on death row, become a superhuman race of vampire-like creatures called Virals. Soon, the population of the earth is either dead or infected, their minds controlled telepathically by the Virals. As most of human civilization has been wiped out by the Virals, the few surviving humans create settlements and live off the land with a fortitude the pilgrims would have admired. Only Amy, an abandoned little girl who becomes a mystical antidote to the creatures&#x2019; powers, will be able to save the world.</p> <p><em>The Passage</em> is no quick read, but a sweeping dystopian epic that will utterly transport one to another world, a place both haunting and horrifying to contemplate. Cronin weaves together multiple story lines that build into a journey spanning one hundred years and nearly 800 pages. While vampire lore lurks in the background--the Virals nick necks in order to infect humans, are immortal and virtually indestructible, and do most of their hunting at night--Cronin is more interested in creating an apocalyptic vision along the lines of Cormac McCarthy&#x2019;s <em>The Road</em>.</p> <p>Taking place in a futuristic America where New Orleans is a military zone, Jenna Bush is the Governor of Texas and citizens are under surveillance, <em>The Passage</em> offers a gruesome and twisted version of reality, a terrifying dream world in which our very worst nightmares come true. Ultimately, like the best fiction, <em>The Passage</em> explores what it means to be human in the face of overwhelming adversity. The thrill comes with the knowledge that Amy and the Virals must face off in a grand battle for the fate of humanity.</p> <p><strong>Questions for Justin Cronin</strong></p> <p> </p> <p><b>Q:</b> What is <em>The Passage</em>?<br> <b>A:</b> A passage is, of course, a journey, and the novel is made up of journeys. But the notion of a journey in the novel, and indeed in the whole trilogy, is also metaphoric. A passage is a transition from one state or condition to another. The world itself makes such a transition in the book. So do all the characters&#x2014;as characters in a novel must. The title is also a reference to the soul&#x2019;s passage from life to death, and whatever lies in that unknown realm. Time and time again I&#x2019;ve heard it, and in my own life, witnessed it: people at the end of life want to go home. It is a literal longing, I think, to leave this world while in a place of meaning, among familiar things and faces. But it is also a celestial longing.</p> <p><b>Q:</b> You are a PEN/Hemingway Award-winning author of literary fiction. Does <em>The Passage</em> represent a departure for you?<br> <b>A:</b> I think it&#x2019;d be a little silly of me not to acknowledge that <em>The Passage</em> is, in a number of ways, overtly different from my other books. But rather than calling it a &#x2018;departure,&#x2019; I&#x2019;d prefer to describe it as a progression or evolution. First of all, the themes that engage me as a person and a writer are all still present. Love, sacrifice, friendship, loyalty, courage. The bonds between people, parents and children especially. The pull of history, and the power of place, of landscape, to shape experience. And I don&#x2019;t think the writing itself is different at all. How could it be? You write how you write.</p> <p><b>Q:</b> <em>The Passage</em> takes place all across America--from Philadelphia to Houston to southern California. What prompted you to choose these specific locations?<br> <b>A:</b> Many of the major locations in the novel are, in fact, places I have lived. Except for a long stint in Philadelphia, and now Houston, my life has been a bit nomadic. I was raised in the Northeast, but after college, I ping-ponged all over the country for a while. In some ways, shaking off my strictly Northeastern point of view has been the central project of my adult life. This gave me not only a sense of the sheer immensity of the continent, but also the great diversity of its textures, both geographical and cultural, and I wanted the book to capture this feeling of vastness, especially when the narrative jumps forward a hundred years and the continent has become depopulated. One of the most striking impressions of my travels across the country is how empty a lot of it is. You can pull off the road in Kansas or Nevada or Utah or Texas and stand in the quiet with only the wind for company and it seems as if civilization has already ended, that you&#x2019;re all alone on the planet. It&#x2019;s a wonderful and a terrifying feeling at the same time, and while I was writing the book, I decided I would travel every mile my characters did, in order to capture not only the details of place, but the feeling of place.<br><br> The writer Charles Baxter once said (more or less) that you know you&#x2019;ve come to the end of a story when you&#x2019;ve found a way to get your characters back to where they started. The end of <em>The Passage</em> is meant to create another beginning, and the space for book two to unfold.</p> <p><b>Q:</b> Your daughter was the spark that set your writing of <em>The Passage</em> in motion. What else drove you to delve into such an epic undertaking?<br> <b>A:</b> The other force at work was something more personal and writerly. One of the reasons that the story of <em>The Passage</em> had such a magnetic effect on me was that I felt myself reclaiming the impulses that led me to become a writer in the first place. Like my daughter, I was a big reader as a kid. I lived in the country, with no other kids around, and spent most of my childhood either with my nose in a book or wandering around the woods with my head in some imagined narrative or another. It was much later, of course, that I formally became a student of literature, and decided that writing was something I wanted to do professionally. But the groundwork was all laid back then, reading with a flashlight under the covers.</p> <p><b>Q:</b> Did you have the narrative completely mapped out before you started, or did certain developments take you by surprise?<br> <b>A: </b> I had it mostly mapped out, but the book is in charge. I split and recombined some characters (mostly secondary ones.) I tend to think in terms of general narrative goals; the details work themselves out as you go, just so long as you remember the destination. And to that extent, the book followed the map I made with my daughter quite closely.</p> <p><b>Q:</b> When will we get to read the next book?<br> <b>A:</b> Two years (fingers wishfully crossed). </p> <br><p><b>Justin Cronin </b>is the author of <i>The Passage, Mary and O&#x2019;Neil</i> (which won the PEN/Hemingway Award and the Stephen Crane Prize), and <i>The Summer Guest</i>.

With the cold war over, the Foreign Office has decided to retire its veteran spies, beginning with McCready, the ``deceiver''--head of Britain's disinformation desk since 1983. McCready balks, demanding a hearing at which his assistant relates four of McCready's most daring exploits. The first and longest, ``Pride and Extreme Prejudice,'' is at once the most suspenseful and melancholic. Here, McCready, having ``turned'' a top Russian general, sends spy-pal Bruno Morenz into East Germany to accept the Russian's latest gift--the Soviet Army War Book; but, unknown to McCready, Morenz has just killed a cheating mistress and is cracking up. When the East Germans catch on to Morenz, who panics into hiding, McCready must sneak across the Iron Curtain, find Morenz, retrieve the book, and deal--irrevocably--with his friend. Also subtly shaded with the grays of spydom is ``The Price of the Bride,'' in which McCready learns from a pro-West Soviet source that the CIA's new prize, defecting KGB colonel Pyotr Orlov, is actually a double agent bent on falsely implicating a top CIA-man as a Soviet mole. It's a masterful spy-vs.-spy battle of wits as McCready sets out to unmask the Russian and save the marked Yank. Less enthralling but still offering solid action and brilliant local color are the two final tales, with McCready acting pivotal but minor roles as he displays his prowess against non-Soviet threats. In ``A Casualty of War,'' he foils an IRA-Qaddafi gun- running scheme, while in the semi-humorous ``A Little Bit of Sunshine,'' he foils a Cuban takeover of a Caribbean island. Not a sizzler like The Day of the Jackal or even The Negotiator (1989) but more resonant than either, with shades of le Carr&#x201a; and Deighton: sophisticated, shrewd, roundly satisfying spy- stuff.

America is a police state, and it is about to be threatened by the most hellish enemy in the world: insects. When the Agency discovered that Dr Hellstroms Project 40 was a cover for a secret laboratory, a special team of agents was immediately dispatched to discover its true purpose and its weaknesses - it could not be allowed to continue. What they discovered was a nightmare more horrific and hideous than even their paranoid government minds could devise.</p><p><b>Frank Herbert</b>&nbsp;is the author of the 1965 science fiction classic, <i>Dune</i>. He&nbsp;passed away&nbsp;in 1986.<b>Chapter One</b>&nbsp;Words of the brood mother, Trova Hellstrom. I welcome the day when I will go into the vats and become one with all of our people.&nbsp;(Dated October 26, 1896.)&nbsp;The man with the binoculars squirmed forward on his stomach through the sun-warmed brown grass. There were insects in the grass and he did not like insects, but he ignored them and concentrated on reaching the oak shadows at the hillcrest with minimum disturbance of the growth that concealed him even while it dropped stickers and crawling things on his exposed skin.&nbsp;His narrow face, swarthy and deeply seamed, betrayed his age&#x2014;fifty-one years&#x2014;but the hair, black and oily, that poked from beneath his khaki sun hat belied these years. So did his movements, quick and confident.&nbsp;At the hillcrest, he drew several deep breaths while dusting the binocular lenses with a clean linen handkerchief. He parted the dry grass then, focused the binoculars, and stared through them at the farm that filled the valley below the hill. The haze of the hot autumn afternoon complicated his examination as did the binoculars, a pair of ten-sixties of special manufacture. He had trained himself to use them the way he fired a rifle: hold breath, concentrate on rapid scanning with only eye movements, keeping immobile the expensive instrument of glass and metal that brought distances into such immediate detail.&nbsp;It was an oddly isolated farm that met his amplified gaze. The valley was about half a mile long, perhaps five hundred yards wide for most of its length, narrowing at the upper end where a thin trickle of water spilled down a black rock face. The farm buildings occupied cleared ground on the far side of a narrow stream whose meandering, willow-bordered bed was only a thin reminder of its spring affluence. Patches of wavering green moss marked the stream&#x2019;s rocks, and there were a few shallow pools where water appeared not to flow at all.&nbsp;The buildings sat back from the stream&#x2014;a cluster of weathered boards and blind glass at rustic variance with the neatness of harvested plantings that ran in parallel rows within cleanly squared fencelines over the rest of the valley. There was the house, its basic unit in the old saltbox pattern, but with two added wings and a bay window on the wing that pointed toward the creek. To the right of the house there was a large barn with big doors on the second level and an upjutting cupola arrangement along its ridgeline: no windows there, but louvered ventilators were spaced along its entire length and at the visible end. Up on the hill behind the barn there stretched a decaying feed shed; a smaller building on this end that could be an old outhouse; another small wooden structure higher on the hill behind the farmhouse, possibly an old pumphouse; and, down by the higher main fence at the valley&#x2019;s northern end, a squat concrete block about twenty feet on a side and with flat roof: new pumphouse was the guess, but it looked like a defensive blockhouse.&nbsp;The watcher, whose name was Carlos Depeaux, made a mental note that the valley fitted the descriptions. It was full of default messages: no people stirring about on the land (although a distinctly audible and irritating machinery hum issued from the barn), no road coming up from the north gate to the farm buildings (the nearest road, a one-way track, came up to the valley from the north but ended at the gate beyond the blockhouse). A footpath with narrow indentations apparently from a wheelbarrow stretched from the gate to the farmhouse and barn.&nbsp;The valley&#x2019;s sides were steep farther up and in places almost craggy with brown rock outcroppings at the top on the far side. There was a similar rocky upthrust about a hundred feet to Depeaux&#x2019;s right. A few animal tracks wound their dusty ribbons through oak and madro�a along the valley sides. The black rock of the tiny waterfall closed off the southern end where a thin cinnamon tracery of water spilled into the stream. To the north, the land undulated away out of the valley, widening into pasture meadows and occasional clumps of pine intermingled with oak and madro�a. Cattle grazed in the far distance to the north and, although there were no fences immediately outside the farm&#x2019;s barrier, tall grass revealed that the cattle did not venture too near this valley. That, too, accorded with the reports.&nbsp;Having satisfied himself that the valley still matched its descriptions, Depeaux wriggled backward behind the crest, found a shaded patch beneath an oak. There, he turned onto his back and brought his small knapsack into a position where he could explore its interior. He knew his clothing would blend well with the grass, but he still hesitated to sit up, preferring to wait and listen. The sack contained his binocular case, a well-thumbed copy of Naming the Birds at a Glance, a good thirty-five-millimeter camera with a long lens, two thin beef sandwiches wrapped in plastic, an orange, and a plastic bottle of warm water.&nbsp;He brought out a sandwich, lay for a moment staring up through the oak&#x2019;s branches, his pale gray eyes not really focused on anything in particular. Once, he pulled at the black hairs protruding from his nostrils. This was an extremely odd situation. Here it was mid-October and the Agency still had not been able to observe the farmers in that valley through an entire harvest. The crops had been harvested, however. That was obvious at a glance. Depeaux was not a farmer, but he thought he recognized the stubby remains of corn plantings, although the stalks had been removed.&nbsp;He wondered why they had cleared away the stalks. Other farms he had seen in the long drive to this valley were still littered with harvest remains. He wasn&#x2019;t sure, but he thought this was another default message in the valley that interested his Agency so much. The uncertainty, the gap in his knowledge, bothered him, however, and he made a note to check on this. Did they burn the stalks?&nbsp;Presently, sensing no watchers around him, Depeaux sat up with his back against the oak&#x2019;s bole, ate the sandwich, and drank some of the warm water. It was the first food he had allowed himself since before daylight. He decided to save the orange and other sandwich for later. It had been a long, slow approach to this vantage point from the place far back in the pines where he had concealed his bicycle. The van and the stake-out where he had left Tymiena were another half hour&#x2019;s bicycle ride beyond that. He had decided not to venture back before nightfall and knew he was going to be very hungry before he got back to the van. Not the first time on such a job. The peculiar nature of this case had become increasingly obvious the nearer he came to the farm. Well&#x2014;he&#x2019;d been warned about that. Stubborn persistence had kept him pressing forward past the imaginary hunger line he knew he&#x2019;d have to pass on the return. The countryside was much more open and empty of concealment than he&#x2019;d expected from the aerial photos, although Porter&#x2019;s reports had made specific mention of this. Depeaux had expected to approach from a different direction, however, and find his own cover. But there had been, finally, only the tall brown grass to conceal his stalking climb across a wide pastureland and up to the hill.&nbsp;The sandwich finished and half his water gone, Depeaux sealed the bottle, restored it and the rest of the food to his pack. For a moment, he peered along his back trail to see if anyone had followed. There was no sign, but he couldn&#x2019;t put down an uneasy feeling that he was watched. The lowering sun was picking up his trail with a shadow line, too. No helping that; the crushed grass represented a track, and it could be traced.&nbsp;He had driven through the town of Fosterville at 3:00 a.m., curious about the sleeping community where, so he was told, they generally refused to answer questions about the farm. There had been a new motel on the outskirts and Tymiena had suggested they spend a night there before reconnoitering the farm, but Depeaux was playing a hunch on this case. What if there were watchers in the town to report strangers to the farm?&nbsp;The Farm.&nbsp;It had been capitalized in all of the Agency&#x2019;s reports for some time, from quite a while before Porter had turned up missing. Depeaux had driven on to a turnoff several miles below the valley and had left Tymiena there shortly before dawn. Now, he was a bird watcher, but there were no birds visible.&nbsp;Depeaux returned to the gap in the grass and had another look into the valley. There had been a massacre of Indians here in the late 1860s&#x2014;farmers killing off the remnants of a &#x201c;wild&#x201d; tribe to remove a threat to grazing stock. As a marker of that all but forgotten day, the valley had been named &#x201c;Guarded.&#x201d; According to a historical footnote Depeaux had located, the original name of the valley was Running Water, after the Indian name. Generations of white farming, however, had depleted the water table and now the water did not run year round.&nbsp;As he studied the valley, Depeaux thought about the record of human nature carried in such names. A casual observer passing this way without doing his homework might think the valley had achieved its name because of its setting. Guarded Valley was a closed-in place with apparently only one real avenue of easy access. The hillsides were steep, a cliff marked the upper end, and only to the north did the valley open out. Appearances could be deceptive, though, Depeaux reminded himself. He had reached his vantage point successfully; his binoculars might just as well be a violent weapon. In a sense, they were: a subtle weapon aimed at the destruction of Guarded Valley.&nbsp;For Depeaux, that pattern of destruction had begun when Joseph Merrivale, the Agency&#x2019;s operations director, had called him in for an assignment conference. Merrivale, a native of Chicago who affected a heavy English accent, had begun by grinning at Carlos and saying, &#x201c;You may have to waste a few of your fellow humans on this one....</p><h2>Mahabharata of Krishna-Dwaipayana Vyasa, 12 volumes</h2><p>In the world of classical literature the Mahabharata is unique in many respects.

Yet after Japan was opened to the West in 1854 and deeper cultural exchange began, Japanese prints captured the European and American imagination. The fresh colors, simplicity of materials, and departure from traditional compositions entranced western artists and the public alike. Likewise, Japanese audiences and artists were intrigued by the styles and techniques of western art, which was broadly available in Japan by the end of the nineteenth century. Artists there created images of the strange foreigners and imagined what American cities looked like.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By the beginning of the twentieth century, artists were not content to merely imagine what the other side of the world looked like. As prints traveled around the globe for study so did artists, and with them spread the tricks and techniques of color woodblock printmaking as well as appreciation for the prints. Woodblock printmakers in the West started to investigate Japanese processes, and Japanese publishers began to seriously seek out the print market outside of Japan. Important themes began to emerge; scenes of nature and old-fashioned architecture outnumbered modern city views, and images of animals were nearly as popular as those of human figures. Imagery was often idyllic and beautiful, attractive to an international audience.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Twentieth-century art, however, moves at a furious pace, and the ferment of the international woodcut style quickly ran its course. Artists appropriated what they needed from the color woodcut, then developed techniques, subjects, and styles in their own ways. An ever-expanding range of prints became indebted to the artists of the previous generation who had reinvigorated woodblock printmaking styles and practices around the world.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This full-color catalogue includes many prints from this colorful exhibition and shows how the progression of styles became more similar as international artists learned from and competed with each other, then stylistically diverged as artists of each country took what they learned in new directions. The three essays each focus on the influences and contributions made to the international style by three countries: Japan, Britain, and America.</p><p>Andrew Stevens is curator of prints, drawings, and photographs at the Chazen Museum of Art at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.&#x201c;One of the must-see shows of the year, the very large and very beautiful <i>Color Woodcut International</i>.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Jacob Stockinger, <i>Wisconsin State Journal</i>, Feb. 15, 2007</p><h2>The Watkins Dictionary of Magic: Over 3,000 Entries on the World of Magical Formulas, Secret Symbols and the Occult</h2><p>This second volume in the popular <i>Watkins Dictionary</i> series is filled with fascinating explanations for all things magical, from spells and secret rituals to mythical creatures.

An orphan taken in by the chief druid of the Carnutes in Gaul, Ainvar possessed talents that would lead him to master the druid mysteries of thought, healing, magic, and battle&#x2014; talents that would make him a soul friend to the Prince Vercingetorix . . . though the two youths were as different as fire and ice.<br><br>Yet Ainvar&#x2019;s destiny lay with Vercingetorix, the sun-bright warrior-king. Together they traveled through bitter winters and starlit summers in Gaul, rallying the splintered Celtic tribes against the encroaching might of Julius Caesar and the soulless legions of Rome. . . .</p><p><b>Morgan Llywelyn</b> has been heralded as the high priestess of Celtic legend. She is the author of many novels, including the international bestseller <i>Lion of Ireland</i>, <i>1949: A Novel of the Irish Free State</i>, <i>The Wind from Hastings</i>, and <i>Red Branch</i>. She lives in Ireland.As every Latin student knows, ancient Gaul was divided into three parts, all conquered by Caesar. Llywelyn tells of that conquest from the viewpoint of the defeated Gauls. Her story is told by the Druid Ainvar, whose"soul friend" Vercingetorix leads the Gauls in their doomed defense of freedom. Llywelyn is most successful in her evocation of Celtic culture and Druidic beliefs, based on harmony with nature. Once Caesar and Vercingetorix join battle, however, the story bogs down in endless marches, raids, and battles. The characters serve the needs of the plot admirably but are never fully fleshed out and compelling in their own right. Less successful than Llywelyn's earlier novels (e.g. Grania: She-King of the Irish Seas , LJ 3/1/86), this one is still likely to please those who enjoy meticulously crafted historical fiction.<br><i>- Beth Ann Mills, New Rochelle P.L., N.Y.</i><br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Late Poems</h2><p><p>The five most recent volumes of poetry published by Thomas Kinsella&#x2019;s own Peppercanister Press&#x2014;<i>Marginal Economy</i>, <i>Man of War</i>, <i>Belief and Unbelief</i>, <i>Fat Master</i>, and <i>Love Joy Peace</i>&#x2014;are gathered together in this collection of the Irish luminary&#x2019;s late work.

Reader&#39;s Digest Cond Bks. Excerpts, American Heritage.</p><p>The Booth family's important place in theater history has often been overshadowed or obscured by the notoriety of John Wilkes. This anecdotal group-biography, by the author of When the Cheering Stopped and other popular history/biography, doesn't help matters much--since nearly half the book is devoted to the largely familiar assassination saga. As a personality, father Junius Brutus Booth (1796-1852) seems the most interesting figure here. The son of a well-to-do London lawyer, young wastrel Junius was unprepossessing offstage but, more than a little mad, became a quick success in frenzied acting roles. He soon ran off to America with his pregnant mistress, abandoning a wife and child; within a year, he was considered the country's most prominent actor and, settling in Maryland, he fathered more children, cultivated many eccentricities, and succumbed frequently to alcoholism. Somber teenaged son Edwin was pushed onstage early; he went through a libertine phase, roughed it on the mining-camp vaudeville circuit, suffered from depression and alcoholism--but emerged, in his unextravagant way, as the era's greatest Hamlet, the ``Prince of Players.'' His little brother Johnny had it easier; with legendary good looks and natural exuberance, his acting fame came without much effort. But, for reasons never made clear, John Wilkes became obsessed with the South's defeat, with the idea of kidnapping and, later, with killing Lincoln. Smith savors every detail of the assassination melodrama, even those--like Mrs. Lincoln's neuroses--that have nothing to do with Booth. By contrast, Edwin's life from 1865 to 1893 (blighted by shame but busy nonetheless) is covered in two sketchy chapters. And the book is limited throughout by Smith's failure to probe or interpret, by his willingness to give equal weight to stories of varying credibility. Readable but only half-satisfying pop-history--more for assassination buffs (Smith brings together many sources) than for fanciers of theater history. (B&amp;w photos--not seen.) -- <i>Copyright �1992, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>Exemplary scholarship and deep feelings shape this portrait of the Booth family, a worthy successor to the author's Lee and Grant and his other well-received historical biographies. As events unfold against a wonderfully detailed evocation of the 19th century, Junius Brutus thrills audiences with his portrayals of Shakespeare's King Lear and Richard III, despite his notorious madness. His equally gifted sons were totally different from their father and each other. A great actor, Edwin could barely utter a word offstage; he was painfully depressed and afraid he too might lose his mind. John Wilkes seems to have been sane: a handsome man beloved by women, gregarious, popular, as admired as Edwin in certain roles. When Robert E. Lee surrendered, however, John's commitment to the Southern cause turned his thoughts to revenge, culminating in his assassination of President Lincoln. In vivid detail Smith reveals the murder's dreadful impact on the Booths and numerous others, mostly innocent victims of a tragedy Shakespeare might have written. Illustrations not seen by PW.

Soon she convinces her sisters to join her. When Sir Ethan notices that his daughters' slippers look tattered every morning, he is certain they've been sneaking out. So he posts a challenge to all the suitors in the kingdom: The first man to discover where his daughters have been is free to marry the one he chooses.</p><p>Meanwhile a handsome young knight named Bedivere is involved in a challenge of his own: to return the powerful sword, Excalibur, to a mysterious lake. While looking for the lake, Bedivere meets the beautiful Rowena and falls for her. Bedivere knows that accepting Sir Ethan's challenge is the only opportunity for him to be with Rowena forever. But this puts both Bedivere and Rowena in a dangerous situation...one in which they risk their lives for a chance at love.</p></p><p>Grade 8 Up&#x2013;This light, entertaining tale combines the Arthurian legend of the Lady of the Lake, Grimms Twelve Dancing Princesses, and elements of romance novels. After Sir Ethans wife, Vivienne, disappears, he vows that no one shall leave him again. He builds an enormous manor that keeps his 12 daughters from the outside world. A crack in a wall is discovered by the youngest, Rowena, and provides a long-desired escape route. At the battle of Camlan, King Arthur is mortally wounded and his knight Bedivere swears that he will honor his sovereigns final request to return Excalibur to the Lady of the Lake (Vivienne). On his journey, he battles the evil Morgan le Fey to protect the sword and meets a monk who sends him in Rowenas direction. They meet in the woods as the young woman discovers her power of second sight when she finds Viviennes scrying bowl with a woman trapped in it, pleading for help. While searching for answers, Rowena and her sisters discover underground tunnels filled with music. Each night they go there to explore but the sorceress le Fey follows them and casts a spell to make sure they do not find their mother. What follows is fairly predictable and everyone lives happily ever after. Though not as substantive as Robin McKinleys <i>Beauty</i> (HarperCollins, 1978) or Donna Jo Napolis <i>The Magic Circle</i> (Dutton, 1993), this story will be enjoyed by readers who like romance novels and fairy-tale retellings.<i>&#x2013;Cheri Dobbs, Detroit Country Day Middle School, Beverly Hills, MI</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.Gr. 7-10. Part of the publisher's growing line of romantic original paperbacks inspired by favorite tales, Weyn's retelling of "The 12 Dancing Princesses," about enchanted sisters who disappear nightly and return with tattered slippers, is more literal than Dia Calhoun's recent <i>The Phoenix Dance</i> (2005). Weyn does, however, introduce a major new element into the traditional story: she premises her version on Arthurian legend, casting the siblings as pawns in a dispute between sorceresses Vivienne and Morgan La Faye, and a Knight of the Round Table as the youngest sister's love interest. The author of the popular sf thriller <i>The Bar Code Tattoo</i> (2004) makes an admirable effort here to inject literary underpinnings into a mass-market genre novel, although the time spent massaging the imposed Arthurian connections might have been better used positing character-driven explanations for events currently governed by destiny and magic. Try this on your starry-eyed readers of romance as an entree to the more psychologically complex fairy-tale retellings of Donna Jo Napoli, Robin McKinley, or Shannon Hale. <i>Jennifer Mattson</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Includes extensive index.</p><p>Text: English, Dutch (translation)</p><h2>On the trail of the Feathered Serpent</h2><p>Peruvian myth tells of a wise man known as Viracocha who sailed away to the north after a period of persecution. And Mexican legend is filled with tales of Quetzalcoatl, a godlike figure who appeared by sea from the south, who established law among the Aztecs, and whose fame grew as a teacher of all things. In Mexico and Yucatan, in the Andean caves, and in the jungles of Peru, extraordinary likenesses have been noted among stone carvings relating to these legends and in the ornamental work found among the ruins of the ancients. Others had dismissed these similarities as coincidence. Gene Savoy felt sure that hundreds of years before the Spanish Conquest - and much earlier than scientists had thought it possible - cultural interchange had taken place between South and Central America. Guided by the legends, he theorized a sea link. To prove his assumption, he set out to duplicate the mythological voyage of Virachocha/Quetzalcoatl from Peru to Mexico. The tale of this daring and exciting sea expedition in a totora reed vessel rivals the adventures of Kon-Tiki. From the first, the expedition seemed doomed to failure. Yet Savoy and his crew of two, pitting their skill and knowledge against the sea, overcame the defects of their craft and the natural hazards of storms, doldrums and tricky currents. This book, profusely illustrated with photographs, maps and drawings, is the dynamic record of one man&#39;s dream become reality, historical theory turned fact, and human endurance triumphant over nature.</p><p></p><h2>Incredible Babies: A Guide and Journal of Your Baby&#x2019;s First Year</h2><p>Very good condition, slight shelf wear.</p><p></p><h2>Yamaha VMX1200 V-Max '85 to '03 (Haynes Service &amp; Repair Manual)</h2><p><p>With a Haynes manual, you can do it yourself�?�¿from simple maintenance to basic repairs.

Soviet imperialism and empiricism was dead and lands, nations, and peoples would henceforth be free from the tyranny of the communist diktat. But it also sounded the death knell of a small, impoverished, and forgotten land-locked state in the Caucasus which had the misfortune to be of geopolitical importance. Stanley Greene&#39;s photographs in Open Wound are so powerful as to make Chechnya our responsibility. He is unashamed to use guilt, with his painter&#39;s eye, to relate the deeds of men in Chechnya to our own conduct.</p><p>Stanley Greene was a painter for many years before turning to photography in 1970. Two years later he enrolled in the School of Visual Arts in New York, and in 1973 transferred to Image Works in Cambridge, Massachusetts. In 1975 Greene enrolled in the San Francisco Art Institute where he received both a BFA and an MFA in photography by 1980. At the same time he co-founded Camera Work Gallery with five other photographers in San Francisco. In 1980, Greene began working for publications including the San Francisco Examiner and Rolling Stone.

Susan has written for numerous magazines, including Cooks Illustrated, Eating Well, Fine Cooking, and Shape. She lives in Connecticut with her family.THE LANGUAGE OF PIES<br><br>Just exactly what is a pie? And when is a pie a tart or a tartlet? When is a pie a flan? The answers can be as confusing as the questions, but as so many types are mentioned in this book, some attempt at definition must be made.<br><br>An American-style pie generally is any pastry crust with a sweet or savory filling baked in a shallow round dish with slanted sides. Pies are served from their baking dishes. Open-faced pies have no top crust. Deep-dish pies have the same kind of fillings as other pies but more of it because they are baked in deeper plates and have no bottom crust. They always have an upper crust.<br><br>A tart is the European cousin of the pie. It generally contains sweetened fruit or preserves or a custard filling, though there are savory tart recipes as well. A tart looks like an open-faced pie: a filled pastry shell. Sometimes tarts, as well as open-faced pies, have pastry-strip lattice crusts. European-style tarts are baked in straight-sided rather than slope-sided pans, often with fluted edges. Before serving, tarts are removed from their baking pans, which are usually made with removable bottoms to facilitate this procedure. In England and France, the words <i>tart</i> and <i>flan</i> are used interchangeably, while in America, tarts and flans are either called tarts or open-faced pies. A flan is actually named for the round metal ring in which it is baked. It is basically a pastry case containing any one of a variety of fillings, like a tart. However, in Spain and parts of France, the term <i>flan</i> can also signify a pudding or molded egg-cream mixture.<br><br>A <i>galette</i> is, literally, a round flat French cake. However, any flat, free-form (as opposed to pan-baked) fruit tart can also be called a galette, or, in Italian, a <i>crostata.</i> The most widely known galettes in France are made for Twelfth Night celebrations and each one contains a good luck charm or tiny porcelain statue of Jesus. In the north of France, Twelfth Night galettes are made of puff pastry, while in the south, they are made with yeast dough.<br><br>The term <i>timbale,</i> according to <b>Larousse Gastronomique</b>, comes from the Arab thabal, meaning drum, and refers to a receptacle. Originally, <i>timbales</i> were metal or earthenware vessels for food. Today, the word may refer to any preparation served in a pie shell with a decorated, glazed pastry top crust molded in a metal form and shaped like a dome.<br><br><i>Pat�</i> is the French word for "paste," meaning dough. The word <i>pat�</i> refers to a totally enclosed pastry case containing a forcemeat, or filling, of meat, vegetables, or (less commonly) fruit. To be strictly correct, pat� should refer only to a pastry-enclosed meat or fish mixture baked in the oven and served hot or cold. By contrast, a <i>terrine</i> can be a sweet dessert layered in a rectangular mold or a savory forcemeat baked without a pastry case (usually in an earthenware vessel, also called a terrine), with strips of fat or bacon on top; terrines are served cold only. And while we are in the family, a <i>galantine</i> is also forcemeat, a terrine in fact, but baked inside boned poultry.<br><br>ABOUT THE RECIPES IN THIS BOOK<br><br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before baking, you may wish to read the sections on equipment and ingredients, to familiarize yourself with information and techniques that will help you succeed.<br><br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before starting a recipe, be sure to read it through from start to finish, so you will know what ingredients and equipment to have on hand, and how to plan your time.<br><br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To achieve success in baking, use the pan sizes specified. A pie plate or tart pan that is too large will not have enough filling; while a pan that is too small may cause the filling to overflow in the oven.<br><br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All dry measurements are level.<br><br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All eggs are U.S. Grade A large (2 ounces).<br><br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I prefer to bake with butter. If you choose to substitute margarine, the flavor will differ somewhat. Use only hard stick margarine, never soft spreads or tub margarines, which will almost always cause baking failures because they contain unknown amounts of water and additives.<br><br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lemon or orange zest refers to the most brightly colored part of the peel, which contains all the flavor. Do not grate the pith or white portion of the peel, which can be bitter.<br><br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lemon juice is best freshly squeezed. If necessary, as a substitute, use Minute Maid "100% fresh lemon juice from concentrate," available in supermarket freezer sections-never an artificial juice.<br><br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nutmeg has a more pungent flavor when freshly grated, but bottled ground nutmeg can be substituted.<br><br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Room temperature means 68 degrees to 72 degrees F. All baking ingredients except fats and water for pastry making should be at room temperature before beginning so they will blend properly.<br><br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oven temperatures vary considerably and are the greatest cause of baking failures. To prevent problems, purchase an oven thermometer in a cookware or hardware store and keep it on the middle shelf inside your oven. Adjust the external oven control indicator as needed to keep the correct internal temperature.<br><br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To double-wrap a baked good for freezing, completely cool it, then wrap it airtight in plastic wrap or foil and place it inside a heavy-duty plastic bag or a crush-proof plastic freezer container marked with a label and date.<br><br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a range is given for doneness, always check the oven at the first time, then watch closely until the second: Your oven and mine may differ, and the only thing that really matters is how the baked product looks. Observe the signs for doneness given in the recipe as well as the time indicators.<br><br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a recipe calls for 1/2 cup chopped nuts, the nuts are chopped before measuring. If it calls for 1/2 cup nuts, chopped, they are chopped after measuring.<br><br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A double boiler is simply a smaller pot that fits inside a larger one containing water. To improvise your own double boiler, you can use a metal bowl or small pot set into a larger pot or frying pan of water. The best arrangement, however, is to suspend the top pot so that its bottom is not actually touching the hot water below.<br><br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the ingredients lists for the recipes, the pastry recipe suggested first is the one I think most suitable. However, other ideas are also suggested-or you may prefer to select your own from the collection of Pastry Recipes.</p><h2>Dido and Aeneas: An Opera (Norton Critical Score)</h2><p><p><strong>An original concept: in one volume, a study-size score of a major musical work, and a comprehensive body of tools for the study of that work.</strong></p><p>Music examples and charts illustrate the analyses, and each essay is fully annotated by the editor.

In the 1670s and &#39;80s he crossed over most of what is now French Canada and the middle United States and charted the length of the Mississippi River--almost always traveling on foot, almost always under dangerous circumstances. Thanks to his pioneering travels, in the next century &#34;America seemed destined to be French, until the Seven Years&#39; War in Europe resulted in a reordering of the New World.&#34; La Salle would not live to see this turnabout. Murdered by two of his servants for reasons that are still unclear, La Salle drifted into history&#39;s cluttered attic, and his deeds have been nearly forgotten. France has yet to erect a memorial to him while in the United States his name lives on as an old car make, an unfitting tribute to that indefatigable walker. Thanks to Muhlstein&#39;s fine study, he may one day earn his due.Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: French</p><h2>Henri Matisse (MoMA Artist Series)</h2><p>Henri Matisse, Pablo Picasso, Joan Mir� and Andy Warhol each significantly shaped the development of art in the twentieth century. These Modern masters are the subjects of four small books, the first volumes in a series featuring important artists in the collection of The Museum of Modern Art. Each book presents a single artist and guides readers through a dozen of his most memorable achievements. Works are reproduced in color and accompanied by informative and accessible short essays that provide background on the artworks and on the artist himself, illuminating technique, style, subject matter and significance. Written by Carolyn Lanchner, former Curator of Painting and Sculpture at the Museum, these books are excellent resources for readers interested in the stories behind masterpieces of the Modern canon and for those who wish to understand the contributions of individual artists to the history of Modern art. This volume focuses on Matisse.</p><p>Carolyn Lanchner was a curator of painting and sculpture at The Museum of Modern Art for over three decades.</p><h2>Flowers over the Inferno (A Teresa Battaglia Novel)</h2><p><b>Ilaria Tuti&#x2019;s debut thriller explores a remote community in Northern Italy&#x2014;a place of secrets, eerie folktales, and primal instincts.</b><br> &nbsp;<br> In a quiet village surrounded by ancient woods and the imposing Italian Alps, a man is found naked with his eyes gouged out. It is the first in a string of gruesome murders.<br> &nbsp;<br> Superintendent Teresa Battaglia, a detective with a background in criminal profiling, is called to investigate. Battaglia is in her mid-sixties, her rank and expertise hard-won from decades of battling for respect in a male-dominated Italian police force. While she&#x2019;s not sure she trusts the young city inspector assigned to assist her, she sees right away that this is no ordinary case: buried deep in these mountains is a dark history that may endanger a group of eight-year-old children toward whom the killer seems to gravitate.<br> &nbsp;<br> As Teresa inches closer to the truth, she must also confront the possibility that her body and mind, worn down by age and illness, may fail her before the chase is over.</p><p><b>Ilaria Tuti </b>lives in Gemona del Friuli, in the province of Udine. She has a degree in economics, has always had a passion for painting, and freelances for a small independent publisher in her spare time. She won the 2014 Gran Giallo Citt� di Cattolica literary prize for her short story &#x201c;The Pagan Child.&#x201d; <i>Flowers over the Inferno</i> is her debut novel.<br>&nbsp; <br><b>Ekin Oklap</b> was born in Turkey, and grew up in Italy. She translates from Turkish and Italian. She currently lives in London, where she works as a literary agent. As a translator, she was shortlisted for the 2016 Man Booker International Prize.<b>AUSTRIA, 1978</b><br> &nbsp;<br> There was a legend that haunted that place, the kind that clings like a persistent odor. It was rumored that in late autumn every year&#x2014;before the rain turned to snow&#x2014;the mountain lake would begin to exhale sinister murmurs.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They came from the water like steam and rose over the banks with the morning mist when the surface of the lake reflected the sky, heaven mirrored in hell. That was when the hissing began, a sound like a protracted howl that enveloped the late nineteenth-century building on the eastern shore of the lake.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The School. That&#x2019;s what they called it, down in the village, though the purpose and the description of the building had shifted through the years, from imperial hunting lodge, to Nazi command center, to a sanatorium for consumptive children.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now there was only silence along its corridors, only peeling walls, crumbling plaster, and the echoes of solitary footsteps&#x2014;and in November, the howling that unfurled through the fog, rising to the top floor windows and onto the pitched roof glistening with frost.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But legends were for children, the elderly and nostalgic, and for the faint of heart. This much, Agnes Braun knew. The School had been her home for long enough that she wouldn&#x2019;t let something like nocturnal whispers get to her. She had memorized the creak of each floorboard and every rusty pipe winding through the entrails of those walls&#x2014;even though most of the building&#x2019;s floors were closed off now, and many rooms boarded shut. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ever since the School had been converted into an orphanage, public funding had dwindled and no private benefactor had come forward with a donation.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Agnes walked across the kitchen, which was situated in the basement between the pantry and the laundry room. Pushing her trolley, she weaved her way through cooking pots that would soon be steaming with greasy vapors. She was alone, at that hour suspended between night and day; her only companions were the shadow of a furtive rat and the shapes of slaughtered animals left to hang inside what used to be an ice box.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She took the service elevator up to the first floor. This part of the building was her responsibility, but recently this task had begun to fill her with a nameless dread, like a latent fever that never quite flared up.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The elevator groaned under the combined weight of her body and the trolley, the chains and the cables began to squeal, and the cage rattled as it rose, coming to a shaky halt a few meters above. Agnes pulled the metal grate open. The damp-stained first floor corridor was a long narrow band of dull blue, with a constellation of large panelled windows on one side.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A windowpane was banging against its frame in a steady rhythm. She left her trolley and went over to close the window. The glass was cold and fogged over; she wiped at it with one hand and made a porthole of sorts. Down in the valley, the light of dawn had begun to illuminate the village. The roofs of the houses looked like tiny lead-colored tiles. Further up, at 1,700 meters above sea level and between the settlement and the School, the motionless expanse of the lake was beginning to turn pink beneath the mist. The sky was clear. But Agnes knew that the sun that day wouldn&#x2019;t bring any warmth to their steep, sloping clearing&#x2014;by now she had learned to interpret the migraines that plagued her the moment she stepped out of bed.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The fog rose to engulf everything in its path: light, sounds, even smells became imbued with its stagnating presence, that essence of ancient bones. It seemed to come to life as it climbed over the frostbitten grass, and from its tendrils came forth those laments.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>The sighs of the dead</i>, thought Agnes.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was the Buran, a fierce north-easterly wind. From its source in distant steppes, it had journeyed thousands of kilometers and forced its way into this valley, roaring against the river banks below the tree line, whirling across the floodplains, and howling as it emerged on the other side, only to crash against the rock wall of the mountain.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>It&#x2019;s just the wind</i>, she kept telling herself.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The pendulum clock in the atrium chimed six times. It was getting late, but Agnes stood still. She was conscious that she was stalling, and she also knew exactly why.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>It&#x2019;s all in your head. All in your head</i>.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She gripped the trolley&#x2019;s metal handle, and the bowls on it clattered as she finally willed herself to take a few steps toward the door at the end of the corridor.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Hive.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her stomach contracted with the abrupt realization that it really was a hive. That&#x2019;s what it had become over the past few weeks. There was a subtle, mysterious buzz of activity about the place, like a diligent insect preparing for metamorphosis. Agnes was sure of it, though she wouldn&#x2019;t have been able to explain what was happening in there. She hadn&#x2019;t said a word to anyone, not even the principal: he would have thought she was going mad.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She put her hand in the pocket of her uniform and her fingers found the coarse material of her hood. She took it out and pulled it over her head. A thin veil covered her face and eyes, obscuring the outside world. That was the rule.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She walked in.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The room was completely silent. A few embers from inside the large cast-iron stove near the door were emitting a pleasant warmth. There were forty cots in the room, arranged in four rows of ten. No names to mark them: only numbers.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There were no cries nor calls. Agnes knew what she would have seen if only she&#x2019;d looked: blank, vacant gazes.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With one exception.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now that she&#x2019;d become accustomed to the silence, she could hear him kicking at the far end of the room, building his strength. He was preparing for something, although she couldn&#x2019;t say what. Maybe she really was insane.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her footsteps brought her closer to cot number 39.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unlike the others, this subject was thriving. His eyes, which were so unusual, were alert and darted about following her movements. Agnes knew that the subject was seeking out her eyes behind the veil of her hood, but she kept looking away, embarrassed. Subject 39 shouldn&#x2019;t have been aware of her presence, and yet . . .<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She checked to make sure that no member of staff was looking through the door, and then she extended a finger. The subject bit it, squeezing her flesh tight between its gums. The expression in its eyes was different now, electric. Agnes pulled back, cursing, and it let out a short, anxious moan.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>That&#x2019;s its true nature</i>, she thought. <i>A carnivore</i>.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What happened next convinced her that she could no longer keep her suspicions private: the cots next to number 39 were no longer quiet. The other subjects&#x2019; breathing had turned agitated, as if they were responding to a call.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Hive was buzzing.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>-1-</b><br><b> TODAY</b><br> &nbsp;<br> The crow lay by the footpath, its crumpled feathers streaked with purple and its beak wide open. There was blood staining the ground beneath its swollen belly, but even in that damp afternoon it had already dried up. Who knew how long the poor creature had been there, one blank eyeball pointing toward a sky that promised snow, and the other eye lost entirely.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mathias had been crouching over it for a while. He wondered whether the fleas had abandoned their host the moment its heart had stopped beating; he&#x2019;d heard a hunter talk about that once, and the thought had tormented him for some time. It was a detail that seemed both fascinating and ominous.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He touched the crow with the tip of his finger. It was an older specimen. He could tell from its beak, which was bald and pale. Its legs had gone stiff, and its sturdy talons gripped thin air.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He quickly wiped his gloves on his trousers. His father would have smacked him if he&#x2019;d found out. He&#x2019;d often caught his son observing the carcasses of small animals in the garden or in the pine grove behind their house, and he&#x2019;d berated him for it, calling him a word Mathias hadn&#x2019;t heard before, but which sounded quite ugly. He&#x2019;d looked it up in the dictionary. He couldn&#x2019;t remember what it meant, but it had something to do with madness.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mathias wanted to be a veterinarian when he grew up, and he&#x2019;d take any chance to learn something. His grandfather had once told him that observing did half the job of learning. The rest would come so long as you tried and tried again. The boy stood up, his eyes still fixed on the animal. At first he wanted to bury it, but then he thought it might be better this way: nature was carnivorous and would appreciate those remains. They would not go to waste.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He heard the church bells in the town ring twice, followed by a third half-chime. It was getting late; the others were waiting for him in their secret place.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He set out along the frozen path. That morning, the village of Traven� had woken up to a coating of snow. It was only a light dusting and had melted away too fast, but it bode well for the forthcoming skiing season. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He reached the bluff that rose near the village. The memorial to the fallen soldiers of the Napoleonic wars soared through the low woodland of spruce and pine trees: a bronze grenadier scowling as he surveyed the horizon, his long mustache curling upwards. A blue scarf fluttered from the tip of his bayonet, indicating that a member of their group had already gotten there and climbed all the way up the statue to set up their signal.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mathias sped up. Earlier that day the teacher had taught them the meaning of the English word &#x201c;leader.&#x201d; It had made a huge impression on him. He liked how definitive it sounded, but most of all he liked the idea of being an example for others to follow.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The teacher had explained that a leader protects his team, which was exactly what Mathias tried to do with his friends. He knew they saw him as the head of their group, and not just because he was the eldest&#x2014;ten years, two months, and two weeks old, to be precise&#x2014;but because they knew they could rely on him.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That was why the scarf tied to the statue should have been his, not Diego&#x2019;s. He should have got there first and led the way, though they all knew that path well enough by now. Instead, he&#x2019;d wasted time staring at some dead animal on the side of the road. Maybe his father was right after all.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The grenadier&#x2019;s bluff was surrounded by sheer rocky cliffs that plunged straight onto the bed of a stream. Water purled through fronds of dark reeds a few dozen meters below.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mathias set out along the path that led down the cliff in sharp turns, bounding along as fast as he could and gripping the fence that flanked the track whenever he felt stones give way beneath the soles of his sneakers. He was out of breath by the time he reached the gravelly riverbed, his knees shaking and his face burning with the effort.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He followed the gully as it unfurled along its winding route, carved out over thousands of years. There were stepping stones over the water and wooden and metal stairways clinging to the rock walls. Beneath the metal grates the river was streaked with ruby-colored light, and smelled of ice. The light and the warmth of the sun rarely reached the depths of the ravine.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mathias could hear the sounds of his own breathing and of his heart beating in his chest, and became aware of how completely alone he was. Tourists tended to favor the ski slopes at this time of year; it was too cold down here, and there was always the risk of a fall.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He started to walk faster without quite knowing why.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The sliver of sky he could see through the sharp peaks of the pine trees some sixty meters above his head was spanned by an old railway bridge from a line that was no longer operational. His grandfather&#x2019;s grandfather had helped to build it, a century and a half ago.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mathias was walking with his face upturned when he slipped on an icy rock and banged his knee. His exclamation was echoed by a sound coming from the forest. A low cry. He spun around, his breathing shallow.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His mother&#x2019;s words leapt to his mind: &#x201c;The forest is no place for children.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He pulled himself up and didn&#x2019;t bother to check for any damage to his jeans or scrapes on the palms of his hands, though he could feel them chafing inside his woolen gloves. He crossed a gangway that led around a protruding boulder. Wet moss on one side, rapids on the other. The path led to a small cave. Mathias ran the length of those few meters in the dark, telling himself it wasn&#x2019;t fear that pushed his legs to go faster, but merely haste.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When he emerged on the other side, he stopped. A ray of sunlight had pierced the green canopy of trees, bathing the undergrowth in gold. The waterfall that powered the stream took a fearsome plunge and sprayed tiny droplets of water as it crashed down; in summer, when there was more light filtering down here, those droplets were traversed by the colors of the rainbow.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His friends were sitting in a circle on the rocky beach, waiting for him. Lucia, Diego, and Oliver. As soon as he saw them, his fears vanished. A smile appeared on his lips. There was no one behind him. No one had followed him there. He looked back defiantly into the dark depths of the cave. He&#x2019;d won; he was a true leader.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But soon his smile dimmed until it disappeared altogether.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was sure of it now.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was someone hiding in the dark, watching him.</p><h2>Usefulness in Small Things: Items from the Under a Fiver Collection</h2><p>Everyday, low-cost, and mass-produced items gathered from around the world showcasing innovative design. This book presents a delightful collection of mass-produced objects that provide insight into the things that surround us. Common items such as nails, plugs, toothbrushes, soap, gloves, and sweets have their own function and differ in design from country to country and region to region. Some are examples of good and practical design, while others fail to fulfill their function. The collection shows an appreciation to detail by revealing how things are made and a sensitivity to the tasks people carry out, all the while keeping in mind the basic utilitarian design of these inexpensive everyday objects. The items come from a range of countries, including the United States, Japan, France, and Thailand, and were purchased from small local shops. More than design souvenirs that celebrate local culture, they all involve an idea about function&#x2014;and in most cases the "designer" is unknown. The book is designed by Graphic Thought Facility and illustrated with over 150 newly commissioned photographs by Angela Moore. The objects are organized thematically, with concise captions that clarify the individual function of each item, exposing what is not always apparent from looking.</p><p>Sam Hecht and Kim Colin are the founding principals of Industrial Facility, a design studio based in London whose clients include Muji, Herman Miller, Issey Miyake, Established and Sons, and Hitachi.

In Her Own Words...<p>"Igrew up in Houston, Texas, the oldest of three sisters. In our house on Mayo Avenue, we had a garage with unfinished Sheetrock on the walls. We each had our own section. As soon as we could hold a crayon, we were allowed to express ourselves in any color or form that we wished.</p><p>"If you stood back and looked at the wall, it was like a record of my growing up. Down at the bottom was just a lot of scribbling, but as I grew, the drawing took on new and clearer forms. You could tell the drawings that were done when I was happy, as well as the ones that I drew when I was angry. The garage wall was a perfect place for expression. Once I started actually writing, on paper, I no longer needed the wall. But I still think of it as the place where my earliest writing took place. It was like my first journal, a record of my feelings and experiences.</p><p>"I still keep a journal. Like the garage wall, it's a place for catching all my thoughts, and sometimes my dreams. It's often the first place that the idea for a new story or poem occurs. Because I don't have any particular rules about writing in my journal, sometimes I'm surprised by what shows up! I also get ideas when I walk. I enjoy taking long leisurely walks. They help me clear my thoughts, but they also give me an opportunity to take a good look at the world around me.</p><p>"I like to draw directly from my own life when I write, because that's what I know best and feel most strongly about. Sometimes I write about feelings of joy, as in my book <i>The Thunderherd</i>, which is about horses. I've loved horses since I was very young, and The Thunderherd was an opportunity to express that love. As much as I loved horses, however, I was afraid of bats. Because writing helps me overcome my fears, I decided to write a book about bats; this became <i>Bat Jamboree.</i> Writing that book helped me see bats differently and even to laugh about my fears. Now I appreciate and love bats almost as much as horses.</p><p>"I used to think that a real writer had to have lots of exciting, maybe even dangerous, adventures in order to have something meaningful to write about. Now I know that the best writing is about the people, places, pets, and objects that surround us and that we meet every day. I've discovered that writing about them is the absolute best way to really know them and in the process come to know ourselves and our own world a little better. I now know that writing is really a way of seeing. I'd like to encourage you to get out your old journal or start a new one and see what shows up.</p><p>"Kathi Appelt lives in College Station, Texas, with her husband, Ken, a schoolteacher, and their two sons, Jacob and Cooper.

A woman is riding an old horse and has a bag full of books to deliver. The families she stops to see are waiting for her, a one-room schoolhouse full of children greet her at the door. One woman walks nine miles to meet her and exchange her books and magazines. This is a day in the life of a pack-horse librarian. From 1935 to 1943, local Kentucky women were paid a meager salary as part of the WPA to do just this. Appelt and Schmitzer present an in-depth look at this unusual book-delivery system. With clear, thorough information, they take readers back to Depression-era Appalachia. Details of the project, such as why local women were the best choice to deliver the books, how materials were obtained, and how the delivery circuit worked, are offered in a readable format. The authors capably describe the isolated and poverty-ridden lives of the Kentucky mountain folk. Generously illustrated with black-and-white photographs, this book paints a complete picture of one WPA project. Extensive source notes are included. Pair this fascinating title with Rosemary Wells's Mary on Horseback (Viking, 1999) for an intimate look at the Appalachian region during the Great Depression.<br><i>Angela J.

The heavy stink draped over the brambles of the brittle brush and prickly cacti to the edges of the asphalt roadways that quarantined the chunk of desert. The barren landscape was illuminated by the blinding afternoon sun. A towering saguaro cast a lengthy shadow on homicide investigators scouring the area amid the foulness stinking in the chill autumn air. At the center of their attention: a large blue Rubbermaid tub wrapped in thick black plastic.<br>Detective David Barnes sensed an almost eerie quiet amid the faint sounds of passing traffic as he crossed the yellow police tape. Suddenly he was struck, his nose assaulted by the rancid stench that permeated the horrific scene. Even to a rookie the smell of death was unmistakable.<br>Slowly, Barnes approached the tub to investigate the origin of the odor. Holding his breath, he peered down into its contents. The detective instantly recoiled, wincing with revulsion. Entombed inside the large plastic container was the body of a male who appeared to have been deceased for quite some time. Immediately Barnes realized two things: The man had been murdered, and his body had been brutally dismembered.<br>In the tub, covered by crumpled black trash bags and clear plastic sheeting, was a disemboweled partial torso. The headless, limbless corpse was severed above the belly button and below the knees. What remained of the body was clothed in a pair of bloody denim shorts held up with a brown leather belt. It was stewing in blood, bone chips, hair, debris, and other bodily fluids.<br>This was an extraordinarily gruesome murder for the quiet Phoenix suburb. Already theories were flying through the detective&#x2019;s mind.&nbsp;<i>Could this be part of some sort of satanic ritual? A mafia hit? Or possibly a drug deal gone bad?</i>&nbsp;Little did Barnes know, the truth would be more bizarre than any initial theory.<br>A gray plastic lid lay adjacent to the tub with tape still stuck to it. On the other side of the tub was a three-inch piece of jagged glass. Part of the plastic sheeting, wet with bodily fluids, had been pulled from the container and lay on the ground near a partially smoked cigarette.<br>Looking down into the tub, Barnes noticed that part of the corpse&#x2019;s abdomen was visible. A coiled-up electrical cord lay on top of the body, along with a slimy piece of orange and black rope. Barnes took a notepad from his pants pocket and scribbled down his preliminary observations. The victim&#x2019;s torso appeared to belong to an overweight, white male in his forties. Barnes stopped writing. Without an ID, head, fingerprints, or any other means of identification, it was impossible to determine much else about the man.&nbsp;<i>This was brutal</i>, Barnes thought.&nbsp;<i>What did he do to deserve this?</i><br>Detective Barnes was a nine-year veteran of the Phoenix Police Department and considered an up-and-comer on the force. Nine months prior, he had been promoted to the coveted homicide division and was eager to prove himself as a capable and keen investigator. In his mid-thirties, tall, with a square chin supported by a powerful jawline, Barnes had a brawny build that filled out the polo shirts he typically wore with plain khaki slacks. He had short cropped hair, warm brown eyes, and ears that protruded ever so slightly.<br>An hour earlier, Barnes had been at home spending time with his children when he got the call from his sergeant: A body had been discovered in the desert. Moments later, he was in his cruiser racing toward the crime scene. By the time he arrived, officers had already cordoned off a large area of land surrounding the body. Barnes was assigned as the lead detective. So far most of his homicide cases had been routine. When he agreed to cover the on-call shift for a fellow detective, he hardly expected to be assigned to such a ghoulish murder.<br>It was a Saturday at about two p.m. A recent rain had strewn small puddles across the desert floor, which glistened in the sunlight. Barnes stepped away from the body and scanned the scene. The vacant swath of desert where the tub had been dumped was east of the intersection of Tatum and Dynamite Boulevards, about thirty miles from the bustling region of downtown Phoenix. Bordering the desert along the east side of Tatum Boulevard was a barbed-wire fence with a large gap wide enough for a vehicle to pass through. A dirt road cut diagonally across the southwest corner of the intersection; at the entrance, a small sign read STATE TRUST LAND, NO TRESPASSING.<br>The vacant desert parcel was blocked on two sides by housing developments. Rooftops could be seen to the west and north, while the areas to the south and east were open desert. Unlike the densely populated downtown region of Phoenix, where many of the city&#x2019;s 1.5 million inhabitants lived and worked, the surrounding neighborhoods consisted of peaceful suburbs, occupied by affluent young residents. Families spent summers here swimming in backyard pools, couples walked their dogs in the evenings, and children rode bikes along the roadways after school.<br>Undeveloped patches of land among the walled-in subdivisions were common in this part of the Valley. The recent boom in the housing market had pushed construction to the edge of the city limits, where homes cropped up like tumbleweeds. Suburban sprawl metastasized outward into the desert, endless concrete and asphalt razing the natural Sonoran splendor. In the surrounding developments, new tract homes were built uniformly, in a limited variety of designs and painted one of half a dozen shades of beige. The sporadic empty desert plots were a constant reminder of what lay underneath the strip-malls, gas stations, and grocery stores&#x2014;an oasis of oblivion.<br>Investigators fanned out along the stretch of desert to collect evidence. Detective Barnes and Officer Barry Giesemann placed protective covers on their shoes and did a walk-through of the area while a crime scene specialist took photographs.<br>&#x201c;Where&#x2019;s the rest of him?&#x201d; Giesemann asked.<br>&#x201c;Who knows?&#x201d; Barnes glanced back at the tub. &#x201c;Maybe we&#x2019;ll find the head somewhere around here.&#x201d;<br>The plastic tub had been dumped about fifty feet from the street, north of a widened area in the dirt road that was just large enough for a vehicle to turn around. On the ground, there appeared to be a faint trace of weathered tire tracks. A slight amount of soil, small pebbles, and dead plant material were scattered to the north side of the tire impression as if dropped by the right wheel when the car pulled ahead. By the time investigators arrived, the tracks were too eroded to identify anything about the vehicle that had been used to dump the body.<br>A few hundred feet from the corpse, clear sheets of crumpled plastic were found tangled in the desert shrubs. All of the other evidence was near the fifty-five-gallon plastic tub. It was covered by a dingy white futon mattress and a tan section of carpet, which did not do much to mask the dirty tub and its grisly contents. Part of the blue tub could be seen from the roadway by any passing motorist. This discovery, however, had been made by a wandering pedestrian.<br>A little after noon, a transient named Robert Aime left the construction site where he was living to grab a six-pack of Bud Light from the gas station. On his way back, he cut across the desert and sat down on the mattress to have a beer and a smoke. That&#x2019;s when he noticed the carpet wrapped around a large tub. With curiosity, the man removed the futon, unwrapped the tub, picked up a broken piece of glass from the bottom of a bottle and cut away at the tape sealing the tub&#x2019;s lid shut. He was hoping he had found something of value, something he could pawn for a few bucks.<br>As he ripped away the black trash bags and pulled out the plastic sheeting, a foul odor started to eat away at his nostrils and an awful taste tickled the back of his throat. He shrank back in horror. The cigarette fell from his lips. Aime ran back to the gas station to call the police. The man was still visibly shaken a few hours later when Barnes approached him for questioning.<br>&#x201c;I saw the belt buckle and the jeans and the belly. It was hairy,&#x201d; Aime said, his voice trembling. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s how I realized it was human. Because there was a belly button.&#x201d;<br>The first person to discover a body was often considered a suspect, but Barnes could tell right away that this man was simply an unlucky witness. The jagged piece of glass and partially smoked cigarette near the tub all seemed to confirm Aime&#x2019;s story. Barnes took down the man&#x2019;s contact information and allowed him to leave.<br>For the next few hours the otherwise peaceful Saturday was buzzing with detectives documenting dozens of pieces of evidence. At around 5:40 p.m. the medical examiner, Dr. Alex Zhang, arrived. A slight Asian man in his late forties, Zhang spoke with a thick accent. He placed the lid back on the tub, zipped the entire container into two black body bags, and took it back to his office for an autopsy. Other evidence found at the site was escorted to the police station to be cataloged.<br>As Barnes drove away from the crime scene that evening, his mind was reeling. This was a savage murder.&nbsp;<i>Who could do that to another human being?</i>&nbsp;he wondered.&nbsp;<i>What kind of person cuts up a body?</i><br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br>Two days after the discovery of the torso, on October 25, Dr. Zhang performed the autopsy. Carefully, he placed the corpse on the metal table and began sorting through the contents of the tub. At the bottom of the box, covered by crumpled trash bags, he discovered a spent .38 caliber bullet. Inside the victim&#x2019;s pockets was $459.10 in mixed bills, a small bottle of contact lens solution, and a key ring with eleven keys.<br>During the autopsy, Zhang discovered that the decomposition of the body was uneven and the deep skeletal muscle tissue was re...</p><h2>Starving the South: How the North Won the Civil War</h2><p><br><br><i>A historian&#x2019;s new look at how Union blockades brought about the defeat of a hungry Confederacy </i><p></p>In April 1861, Lincoln ordered a blockade of Southern ports used by the Confederacy for cotton and tobacco exporting as well as for the importation of food. The Army of the Confederacy grew thin while Union dinner tables groaned and Northern canning operations kept Grant&#x2019;s army strong. In <i>Starving the South, </i>Andrew Smith takes a gastronomical look at the war&#x2019;s outcome and legacy. While the war split the country in a way that still affects race and politics today, it also affected the way we eat: It transformed local markets into nationalized food suppliers, forced the development of a Northern canning industry, established Thanksgiving as a national holiday and forged the first true national cuisine from the recipes of emancipated slaves who migrated north. On the 150th anniversary of the Battle of Fort Sumter, Andrew Smith is the first to ask &#x201c;Did hunger defeat the Confederacy?&#x201d;.<br><br></p><p><br><br>ANDREW F. SMITH is a faculty member at the New School and editor-in-chief of <i>The Oxford Encyclopedia of Food and Drink in America. </i>He lives in New York.<br><br>1<br>&nbsp;<br>Lincoln&#x2019;s Humbug of a Blockade<br>&nbsp;<br>Abraham Lincoln was elected the sixteenth president of the United States on November 6, 1860. He opposed the extension of slavery into new territories, and his election convinced many Southerners that it was time to leave the Union. By the time of Lincoln&#x2019;s inauguration on March 4, 1861, seven slaveholding states had seceded, immediately expropriating as much Federal property as they could, including arsenals, forts, military camps, and the United States Mint in New Orleans. Eight other slave-holding states remained in the United States, but any precipitate action by the new administration might tip them into seceding as well.<br>The Lincoln Administration confronted many crises, but the most volatile was what to do with a few remaining Union-held forts in states that had seceded. Fort Sumter was the flashpoint: It controlled the entrance to Charleston, South Carolina&#x2019;s largest port. The fort was garrisoned by a small army detachment commanded by Major Robert Anderson, a pro-slavery, former slave owner from Kentucky. Anderson attended West Point, where he met Kentucky-born Jefferson Davis and tutored a Creole from Louisiana named Pierre T. G. Beauregard. In 1861, the commander of the Confederate troops stationed in Charleston was Beauregard, who under orders from Jefferson Davis, then the provisional president of the Confederacy, refused permission for Anderson&#x2019;s garrison to buy food and supplies in Charleston. Instead, Davis and Beauregard demanded that Anderson surrender the fort. Anderson refused. By early March 1861, the fort began to run out of provisions. Anderson told the War Department that &#x201c;unless we receive supplies I shall be compelled to stay here without food, or to abandon this post.&#x201d;1<br>All Loyal Citizens<br>Lincoln&#x2019;s cabinet was divided about whether to send provisions to the garrison. William Seward, the U.S. Secretary of State, favored withdrawal, as did Simon P. Cameron, the Secretary of War, and Gideon Welles, Secretary of the Navy. Relieving the fort, they argued, would require an army and a navy that the United States just did not have. Others disagreed. Salmon P. Chase, Secretary of the Treasury, and Montgomery Blair, the Postmaster General, thought that surrendering the fort would be treason, and any such action would dampen the morale of the many Unionists who lived in the slave-holding states. Others feared that withdrawal would be tantamount to official recognition of the Confederacy.<br>Lincoln concluded that if the Union troops evacuated Fort Sumter, the nation would be irrevocably split in two. At a cabinet meeting on March 28, 1861, he made the decision to send provisions to the Union garrison at the fort. A small flotilla of vessels loaded with supplies left Northern ports on April 5. When the ships arrived off the coast of South Carolina six days later, Beauregard gave Anderson a choice of immediately surrendering or facing bombardment. Anderson declined to surrender, and at 4:30 a.m. on April 12, 1861, batteries fired on the fort.2&nbsp;The cannonade continued through the following day, until Anderson agreed to a cease-fire. On April 14, Anderson and his men lowered the American flag, boarded the ships that had come to supply the fort, and headed north. Thus ended the first military engagement of the Civil War.<br>Even before the Confederate artillery fired the first shots of the Civil War, various proposals were circulating in Washington on how best to encourage the South to return to the Union. Winfield Scott, the General-in-Chief of the U.S. Army and a Virginian by birth, is credited with the proposal to blockade the Confederacy&#x2019;s Atlantic and Gulf ports and then to take control of the Mississippi River. Such actions would prevent war materiel from coming into the Confederacy from abroad and would split the Confederacy in two. After the South stagnated commercially, it would then peacefully rejoin the Union, or so proponents believed. The plan was leaked to the press, where it was disparagingly referred to as the &#x201c;boa-constrictor,&#x201d; the &#x201c;anaconda,&#x201d; or &#x201c;Scott&#x2019;s Great Snake.&#x201d;3&nbsp;The press and the public wanted no part of it. Northern newspapers demanded the immediate conquest of Richmond and a speedy end to secession.<br>On April 15&#x2014;one day after Fort Sumter surrendered&#x2014;Lincoln issued a proclamation calling for the mobilization of 75,000 volunteers to suppress the rebellion. In the North, the proclamation generated widespread support and unity. In the South, four states responded to Lincoln&#x2019;s call by seceding from the Union, and strong secession movements pressed the remaining four slave-holding states to follow their example.<br>Within the Lincoln Administration, debate ensued about whether to declare a blockade of the Confederacy. It was Jefferson Davis&#x2019;s action that tipped the debate in favor of doing so. Two days after Lincoln&#x2019;s call for volunteers to suppress the rebellion, Davis invited applications for &#x201c;Letters of Marque&#x201d; authorizing Confederate agents to seize and destroy American merchant ships. On April 19, Lincoln responded by declaring a blockade of Southern ports with the intent of preventing cotton, tobacco, and sugar from being exported and military equipment and supplies from coming into the South from abroad.4<br>Declaring a blockade was easy; enforcing it was another matter. The South had nine major ports and more than 3,500 miles of coastline, and it would be impossible for the North to prevent small ships from landing goods along thousands of bays, inlets, rivers, and islands. The Federal navy had only ninety ships at the beginning of the war, and more than half of these were outmoded sailing ships, many of them unseaworthy. As soon as Lincoln declared the blockade, the Navy Department recalled naval ships from foreign waters, purchased merchant ships, which were quickly converted into gunboats, and launched a major shipbuilding program. Within weeks, the United States had 150 ships ready for duty, and construction had begun on another 50 ships.<br>As ships returned from abroad and new ships came on line, the blockade became more effective. By December 1861, the navy had 264 ships on line, and the effects of the blockade were &#x201c;severely felt&#x201d; in the Confederacy.5<br>The Provision Blockade Is Nothing<br>Most Southerners did not see the blockade as a serious threat. Some, in fact, welcomed it. Jefferson Davis called it &#x201c;a blessing in disguise,&#x201d; believing that the blockade would force England and France &#x201c;to a speedy recognition of the Confederacy, and to an interference with the blockade.&#x201d; Even if the blockade became effective and England and France were not drawn into the conflict, Southerners concluded that &#x201c;Lincoln&#x2019;s humbug of a blockade&#x201d; would still not succeed because of the South&#x2019;s abundant food supply. As one Confederate officer in Nashville proclaimed, &#x201c;The provision blockade is nothing; we shall have wheat, corn, and beef beyond measure, besides tobacco, sugar, and rice.&#x201d; No one imagined that the blockade of the Atlantic and Gulf ports would have much of an impact on the availability, distribution, or cost of food in the Confederacy.6<br>Although the Anaconda plan was never officially approved, a modified version of it shaped Union strategy after the Northern defeat at Bull Run in July 1861. Southerners were well aware of the supposed &#x201c;anaconda&#x201d; strategy of the North, and many called it a &#x201c;starvation policy.&#x201d; This Anaconda strategy was well understood in both the North and South, and regular mention of the serpent&#x2014;&#x201c;contracting coils of the anaconda,&#x201d; the &#x201c;embraces of the Northern anaconda,&#x201d; &#x201c;the great anaconda has begun to enfold,&#x201d; or &#x201c;strangulation by the great anaconda,&#x201d;&#x2014;appeared in both Northern and Southern newspapers and magazines as the war progressed.7<br>An assistant to Jefferson Davis accurately foretold Union strategy, which was &#x201c;to take our chief sea-coast cities, so as to cut off all supplies from foreign countries, get possession of the border States of Kentucky, Missouri, and Tennessee, which are the great grain-growing States, properly belonging to the Confederacy; cut the railway connections between Virginia and the cotton States, and cut the cotton region in two divisions by getting full possession of the Mississippi River by getting possession of the sea-coast cities on the one side and the principal grain-growing region on the other; by separating the cotton region of the Confederacy from Virginia and cutting it into two separate divisions; by commanding completely the Mississippi River, they expected to starve the people into subjection.&#x201d;8<br>Severely Felt<br>The U.S. Navy needed coaling and supply depots in the South to resupply blockading ships. On August 28, 1861, Federal forces captured Fort Hatteras and Fort Clark on Cape Hatteras Inlet on North Carolina&#x2019;s Outer Banks, and later captured Roanoke, New Bern, Elizabeth City, and Plymouth. In South Carolina, U.S. Army and Navy units seized Fort Walker and Fort Beauregard, guarding the entrance to Port Royal Sound. On November 24, 1861, the North seized Tybee Island in Georgia near the Savannah River estuary and immediately began constructing long-range batteries to fire on Confederate-occupied Fort Pulaski, which surrendered months later. From forts and fortified positions on offshore islands, Federal gunboats prevented coastwise trading. These conquests also gave the United States access to the South&#x2019;s food production areas, among them the fertile strip of land along the coast of the Carolinas and Georgia; raiding parties ventured far into the hinterland confiscating commodities, dismantling the dikes, and flooding the rice fields. As a result, rice and other food production in these areas nosedived.9<br>From the beginning, the blockade reduced food imports into the South. Coffee, tea, spices, and wine quickly became difficult to acquire. More important losses from a nutritional standpoint were apples and dairy products, such as butter and cheese, which had been imported from New England; citrus fruits, dates, pineapples, and vegetables, which had been imported from Bermuda and the Caribbean islands became scarce, as did salt (used as a preservative), which had been mainly imported from abroad before the war. The nutritional effects of these losses increased as the war progressed.<br>The Confederacy did permit ships, mainly operated by private enterprises looking to make sizable profits, to run the blockade. Blockade-runners brought in much needed military equipment and supplies, but the most profitable part of their cargoes consisted of luxury goods, such as silks, laces, spices, molasses, liquor, sugar, coffee, and tea. What the South needed was machinery, salt, zinc, iron, steel, and copper, but these were heavy and bulky, and these items produced much smaller returns. The Confederate government tried to regulate blockade-runners, but this usually lessened the willingness of private entrepreneurs to risk having their ships and cargoes captured. Although the Confederacy finally outlawed the importation of alcoholic beverages and some other luxury goods, bans proved ineffective and these items were available in the Confederacy up to its final days&#x2014;for those able to pay for them.<br>Starving the People of New Orleans<br>The most important port on the Gulf Coast was New Orleans&#x2014;the largest city in the Confederacy. Southern officials believed that the city&#x2019;s formidable forts and some hastily converted and constructed naval vessels were powerful enough to repulse any possible Union invasion coming from the Gulf, so the regular military units stationed in New Orleans were sent northward to block the expected Federal campaign down the Mississippi River from Illinois. This left only an inexperienced home guard in the city proper, with limited supplies. When the Mississippi was closed to traffic in August 1861, the flow of grain and other foodstuffs from the Midwest to New Orleans was halted. During the following eight months, the city&#x2019;s storehouses were depleted. The food situation became desperate enough for city officials to make the outlandish request that Virginia send a trainload of grain every day to prevent famine in New Orleans.10<br>On April 24, 1862, the Union Flag Officer David G. Farragut, a Tennessean by birth, achieved strategic surprise when he led a flotilla past the forts protecting New Orleans and sank the ships sent to stop him. After an intense bombardment, the two forts surrendered, and the flotilla turned upriver toward New Orleans. The Confederate home guard evacuated the city, fearing that the meager supplies of flour and meat would not hold out during a siege.11&nbsp;Northern troops occupied New Orleans, and the South lost its largest city, with its strategic location on the Mississippi River, its ship-building facilities, and its large industrial base.<br>When the Union military arrived in New Orleans, they had to offer provisions to &#x201c;the starving people of New Orleans,&#x201d; as&nbsp;<i>Harper&#x2019;s Weekly</i>&nbsp;reported it. The city&#x2019;s former Confederate authorities were blamed for the famine situation in New Orleans. The article continued, condemning Confederate officials: &#x201c;If the leaders of this accursed rebellion could have looked upon the sight and reflected upon their responsibility for all this misery, it would have been strange if they had not experienced some dark forebodings of the terrible punishment that surely awaits them in another world, however easily they may escape a just retribution in this.&#x201d;12<br>Farragut wasn&#x2019;t satisfied with just taking New Orleans. In a lightning move, he sent a small flotilla under the command of Commander S. Phillips Lee up the Mississippi River. The flotilla occupied Baton Rouge on May 5, and Natchez five days later. On May 18, the ships arrived before Vicksburg and fired a few shots into Confederate positions. But the Confederates in Vicksburg refused to surrender, and Commander Lee&#x2019;s few troops were unable to take the city, so the flotilla turned back to New Orleans. Thus ended the first feeble Union attempt to take Vicksburg, a key port on the middle section of the Mississippi River.<br>With the occupation of New Orleans, Baton Rouge, and Natchez, the Union solidified its control of the lower Mississippi; this gave Federal troops access to rich agricultural areas in Louisiana and Mississippi. Beginning in the fall of 1862, Union troops under the command of Major General Benjamin Butler began to confiscate or destroy agricultural commodities and production facilities in lower Louisiana. Some plantations were deliberately reduced to ashes by Union troops in order to prevent food from falling into Confederate hands. Other plantations succumbed to the foraging activities of both armies. Still other plantations were simply abandoned by their owners, who took their slaves to more protected places further inland. Levees in Louisiana wore down or were torn down and agricultural machinery fell into disrepair or was destroyed. Louisiana produced 270,000 tons of sugar in 1861, but three years later production had dropped to a total of only 5,400 tons.13&nbsp;Similar declines in the production of other agricultural commodities turned much of eastern Louisiana into an agricultural wasteland.<br>The Federal presence in New Orleans and along the Gulf Coast was enough to encourage slaves to flee plantations.

After both his parents were murdered in concentration camps, he spent World War II in a forced labor camp; he died a suicide in Paris in 1970. Taken from his last three verse collections published in Germany, Last Poems contains short, fragmentary, free-verse explorations of a semiabstract universe in which a shattered soul confronts sounds, violent motions, stones, empty space. "In the gap of the calendar/ the newborn/ Nothing/ rocks him, rocks him." Memories of his Holocaust experiences are embedded like bullets in stained glass. Even when Celan does not deal directly with the Nazi years, the pressure of the past weighs heavily; he warns a crocus, "You need every blade." The translators' use of a plethora of compound words (pre-flood, hatchet-swarms) to cope with Celan's German coinages is understandable but not always effective. A critical apparatus would have been helpful. Most of the poems in this bilingual edition have never before been translated into English. <br>Copyright 1986 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Gospel of Judas, Critical Edition: Together with the Letter of Peter to Phillip, James, and a Book of Allogenes from Codex Tchacos</h2><p>For the first time in a single volume, discover the complete text of Codex Tchacos&#x2014;the remarkable ancient papyrus book that contains the <i>Gospel of Judas.</i> Hidden for 1,600 years in an Egyptian cave, only to be found, traded, and all but destroyed before its restoration began in 2001, Codex Tchacos contains four texts that shed important light on the ancient world and the emergence of Christianity.<br><br>Featuring beautifully rendered, full-color photographs of the original papyrus pages alongside the Coptic text and its English translation, this critical edition provides everything needed for a full examination of the Codex.

It is always much bigger and grander than the house I live in. Once its long windows looked out on fields of lavender in Provence. In the dream I think, Why didn&#x2019;t I figure this out before? It&#x2019;s simply a matter of finding a door.<br><br>I sat in church near the altar on a Thursday evening in April, waiting for it all to begin. Watery blue light fell from the high windows onto the fair linen, empty as a pocket. The altar was wooden and plain, ordered from a Lutheran catalog specializing in church furniture. The wine, shortly to sit on the altar in a little silver chalice that a priest found in a second-hand store, was cheap Christian Brothers cream sherry; the wafers were the whole wheat variety made by nuns in Clyde, Missouri. The table, the wine, the wafers were as everyday, as ordinary as my house, and also contained within and behind them a reality as complex, as beautiful, and as hidden as the house in my dream.<br><br>Prayers rose from the kneelers; I breathed in the stone-cooled air. In a few minutes, others arrived for this Thursday-evening service. An attorney for legal aid, an advocate for abused children, a heating serviceman, a realtor. Someone new, a woman with short reddish-brown hair wearing a cream-colored suit. They walked in from the street and stood in the cool dark, looking momentarily lost or disoriented, as if they had crossed a border and were in need of new currency, and then sat down.<br><br>Mark Asman, our parish priest, arrived last, in a black suit, clerical shirt, and collar. In Mark&#x2019;s breast pocket was a small leather church calendar in which he kept, in a round, scrawled hand, dates for meetings on the pages marked with the names of martyrs and saints. On that calendar was a meeting on &#x201c;human sexuality,&#x201d; scheduled for June 11, a feast day for St. Barnabas, an apostle.<br><br>As Mark settled in, a stranger with dirty clothes and a stubbled chin walked unevenly into the church and sat down in a shadowed pew. He had &#x201c;homeless&#x201d; written all over him. Probably drunk. Mark motioned for him to come up to the altar area. He staggered slightly as he climbed the steps. When we stood for the Gospel reading, he reached for Mark&#x2019;s hand and held onto it, his fingers knotted with Mark&#x2019;s like lovers, for the rest of the service.<br><br>Ann Jaqua, a laywoman, gathered up her notes and headed for the lectern. The theme for her homily that night was &#x201c;Mysticism 101.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Here at the end of the twentieth century, we have difficulty with anything that is neither apparent to the senses nor obvious to the intelligence,&#x201d; Ann began. &#x201c;We are caught in a restricted way of knowing that the scientific world has given us. And, as Huston Smith says, the scientific method only measures those aspects of reality we can control, leaving out all those aspects that are beyond our ability to control. All things that exceed us in freedom, intelligence, and purpose, things that cannot be pinned down.&#x201d;<br><br>After the sermon and the peace, Anne Howard, the priest who was celebrating that night, held her palms over the bread and wine. She said, &#x201c;Breathe on these bodily things.&#x201d;<br><br>People asked for prayers: for my daughter who has eczema on her hands; in thanksgiving for my sister who, so far, is enduring chemo, her hair has not fallen out; I asked for prayers for the soul of my brother, Kit, and stood in their midst shaking with tears. They held their palms like light wings over my back and shoulders. Anne rubbed oil that smelled of rosemary into my forehead, and made the sign of the cross. Breathe on us.<br><br>When Anne raised her hand to bless us at the end of the service, the drunk raised his hand, too, and, right along with her, made the sign of the cross over us all. We were there, empty as the altar, becoming flesh.<br><br>When my husband, Vincent, and I came home from New Mexico after Kit&#x2019;s death, cards from the people at church were stacked up on the white table next to our front door like leaves on a lawn. Mark Benson, who served on my discernment committee, read a verse from Dr. Seuss into the answering machine and I scribbled it on a scrap of paper from my brother&#x2019;s house: &#x201c; &#x2018;The storm starts when the drops start dropping. When the drops stop dropping, then the storm starts stopping.&#x2019; It feels to me like what grief is like.&#x201d;<br><br>Outside, green lawns and ivy, fields of yellow mustard, wild lilac loosed on the hills, palm trees, and beach sand. It was not like New Mexico where Kit and I grew up and where I had just left his ashes. In New Mexico dark mesas rise off the desert floor, heart-shaped leaves of cottonwoods dance by the river, orchards are fed by each village&#x2019;s acequia madre, the mother ditch.<br><br>I dreamed of a piece of pottery I found on land I own near Santa Fe. It was colored gray, like ashes, and had the remains of a design on it, a black V. I thought of the people who had made that jar, walking, then falling, their bones intertwined in the roots of the sagebrush under my feet, and then I put it back where I had found it, in a streambed fed by summer rains.<br><br>A bouquet of flowers arrived from the monks at Mt. Calvary monastery. The card read, &#x201c;With love from your brothers.&#x201d;<br><br>Vincent and I couldn&#x2019;t do simple things. We couldn&#x2019;t go to the grocery store or cook dinner. On our first night back, an insulated carry-all appeared on the front porch, left there by Dodie Little, from Trinity. Inside was a cooked chicken, potato salad, green beans, and brownies. I realized that had she not brought it to us, we would not have eaten.<br><br>In the week ahead, I could hardly bear to be in church. I couldn&#x2019;t be in large rooms or with many people at once. I suffocated on the living. I believed no one noticed, until Mark Asman took me aside and said, &#x201c;Are you having trouble with crowds since Kit died?&#x201d;<br><br>I felt as if I was wandering around in a newly discovered archeological dig where there are pieces of things all over the ground&#x2014;pottery shards, abandoned campsites, and bones&#x2014;and that someday someone would come along and make sense of them.<br><br>I would be watering the garden or opening an envelope and Kit&#x2019;s death would spring on me completely new and jolting, as if I&#x2019;d been hit hard from behind with no warning, and I then would fold up, like a fan.<br><br>Parts of my life, the life I led before Kit grew sick and died, no longer made sense. A life of meetings, stretched between appointments, always ten minutes late. Half listening to people. A life dictated by clocks and money and computers and cars, without hawks and lakes and wild roses, a world increasingly without surprise or humor. I thought of how we as a species have endangered not only animals and plants around us, but the wild nature of our own lives. We have fabricated this world, to paraphrase the writer Philip Sherrard, and our punishment is that we have to adapt to it.<br><br>I half realized, as I stood in the wreckage of my brother&#x2019;s death, that I had lost more than Kit; I&#x2019;d lost my own wild life, I&#x2019;d lost the sacred in the world. By the life I was leading, I had lost much of the holy, and my job now, if one could call it a job, was to find it again but in a different place.<br><br>I thought of a story about Dan Corrigan, a retired Episcopal bishop. Dan was famous in the church for breaking rules. He had been arrested during the Vietnam War for saying Mass on the Pentagon steps, had advocated the ordination of homosexuals in the fifties, and had been nearly shot by a Mississippi state trooper when he went down to speak of civil rights at a black college in 1952. He and other bishops and priests spoke for the ordination of women to the priesthood from the late sixties onward, but the national church&#x2019;s governing bodies did not act. In 1974, after much deliberation, conversation, and prayer, he and two other bishops stepped into the breach and ordained eleven women to the Episcopal priesthood in Philadelphia, without benefit of church permission, risking censure and revocation of their licenses to preach and preside. Dan was in his eighties at the time.<br><br>Anne Howard was saying goodbye to Dan one day up at the monastery.<br><br>&#x201c;Take care of yourself, Dan,&#x201d; said Anne, turning to walk out the door.<br><br>Dan stopped, and said, &#x201c;No, I don&#x2019;t think so.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I beg your pardon?&#x201d; Anne asked.<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t take care of myself,&#x201d; Dan replied. &#x201c;I spend myself.&#x201d;<br><br>I felt an urgency to reclaim the holy in my life, to find a new way to spend myself. Kit&#x2019;s death gave that desire weight, a kind of gravity. His death and its aftermath were benchmarks against which I measured the clarity or falsehood of my next steps, the next path.<br><br>And thus I set out to do something new as a way to come to myself, a new way to spend myself.<br><br>Since Kit&#x2019;s death, I have been visited&#x2014;there is no other word for it&#x2014;by birds. Driving north on Highway 101, a red-tailed hawk flies low over the hood of my car, so close I can see the black bead of his eye. Sitting in a garden of a retreat house near Malibu, the wide Pacific Ocean spread before me, a hummingbird zips to within a foot of my face. The day of Kit&#x2019;s death, I found myself, without knowing how I got there, standing in the midst of a bird refuge near his house, listening to the ducks in the rushes and millet, and watching the movement of wind on the water. I could not make sense of these events, but they had the quality of something larger, or deeper, Simone Weil&#x2019;s &#x201c;events of a different order.&#x201d; They, too, counted in my next decision, although I did not know how or why.<br><br>In the midst of this year of discernment, as I sat with those four people, four other souls, for three hours once a month and listened for the word of God that was often like the sound of wind, or the motion of birds, I knew that Kit&#x2019;s death echoed into this. His death had a wake, the way everything has a sound.<br><br>It started for me as a series of dreams. In each of them, I served the Eucharist bread, the bread or wafers that can be blessed only by a priest. (A priest consecrates the bread, but this consecra- tion can&#x2019;t be done alone. The Eucharist must be celebrated in community.)<br><br>I was never inside a church, I was always walking outside, sometimes in the countryside, sometimes in city streets. Once, I served rice. A few grains in my palm became a never-ending supply, a fine puffy mound, as long as I gave it away. I served it to groups of people standing on the street. As I lifted my palm to a woman dressed in a neat black suit, diamond earrings, and a red fox coat and offered, politely, &#x201c;The Body of Christ?&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;Oh, yes, I could use that.&#x201d;<br><br>In one dream, I sifted through a covered tray for bits of bread to serve. The tray was like one my mother used at cocktail parties to collect ashes and cigarette butts. I had to be careful to distinguish between the wafers and the trash. It was very important to get everyone fed, and on the right food. In another, I held Jesus&#x2019; coat. In yet a third, Nelson Mandela, who was giving the homily at Trinity, for some dream-like reason, turned to me and said, &#x201c;And when are we going to get you preaching?&#x201d;<br><br>Whatever it was, it did not go away. Mark Benson sent me a card with a medieval woodcut of a shepherd carrying a particularly nasty-looking child on his shoulders up a steep canyon, with the inscription, &#x201c;Get off my back, Jesus.&#x201d; Inside Mark wrote, &#x201c;Is the Hound of Heaven hounding you?&#x201d;<br><br>Any person serious about her faith has probably looked up from pew or chair and thought, I wonder what it&#x2019;s like to be . . . up there? To dedicate one&#x2019;s life to the celebration at the altar, to be at the heart of life-changing events of people&#x2019;s lives, to make a difference. To go all the way. Not to mention getting focused attention, wielding power, and wearing those great clothes. And also&#x2014;I would learn much more about this over the next three years&#x2014;after you&#x2019;ve been a member of a faith community for some time, you begin to wonder, Isn&#x2019;t there something besides sitting down, standing up, and singing? Isn&#x2019;t there anything more?<br><br>I sought what Ann Jaqua calls my true self, or some kind of completion. I feared what Rilke called the &#x201c;repository of unlived lives.&#x201d; I knew I wanted to do this with my community and in my community. I did not want to be the Lone Ranger.</p><h2>MAGICIAN: THE AUTHOR&#39;S PREFERRED EDITION (Riftwar Saga)</h2><p>In a strange realm of princes, priests, soldiers, and soothysayers, young Pug, apprenticed to a master magician, becomes embroiled in a war with another galaxy and strives to save his world</p><p></p><h2>The High Druid of Shannara Trilogy</h2><p><b>The complete three-book series</b><br><br>In one handsome collector&#x2019;s edition hardcover, here are all three novels that comprise Terry Brooks&#x2019;s bestselling High Druid of Shannara trilogy&#x2014;<i>Jarka Ruus, Tanequil, </i>and <i>Straken</i>.

He is the author of more than thirty books, most of which have been&nbsp;<i>New York Times</i>&nbsp;bestsellers. He lives with his wife, Judine, in the Pacific Northwest.ONE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> She sat alone in her chambers, draped in twilight&#x2019;s shadows and evening&#x2019;s solitude, her thoughts darker than the night descending and heavier than the weight of all Paranor. She retired early these days, ostensibly to work but mostly to think, to ponder on the disappointment of today&#x2019;s failures and the bleakness of tomorrow&#x2019;s prospects. It was silent in the high tower, and the silence gave her a momentary respite from the struggle between herself and those she would lead. It lasted briefly, only so long as she remained secluded, but without its small daily comfort she sometimes thought she would have gone mad with despair.<br> &nbsp;<br> She was no longer a girl, no longer even young, though she retained her youthful looks, her pale translucent skin still unblemished and unlined, her startling blue eyes clear, and her movements steady and certain. When she looked in the mirror, which she did infrequently now as then, she saw the girl she had been twenty years earlier, as if aging had been miraculously stayed. But while her body stayed young, her spirit grew old. Responsibility aged her more quickly than time. Only the Druid Sleep, should she avail herself of it, would stay the wearing of her heart, and she would not choose that remedy anytime soon. She could not. She was the Ard Rhys of the Third Druid Council, the High Druid of Paranor, and while she remained in that office, sleep of any kind was in short supply.<br> &nbsp;<br> Her gaze drifted to the windows of her chamber, looking west to where the sun was already gone behind the horizon, and the light it cast skyward in the wake of its descent a dim glow beginning to fail. She thought her own star was setting, as well, its light fading, its time passing, its chances slipping away. She would change that if she could, but she no longer believed she knew the way.<br> &nbsp;<br> She heard Tagwen before she saw him, his footfalls light and cautious in the hallway beyond her open door, his concern for her evident in the softness of his approach.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Come, Tagwen,&#x201d; she called as he neared.<br> &nbsp;<br> He came through the door and stopped just inside, not presuming to venture farther, respecting this place that was hers and hers alone. He was growing old, as well, nearly twenty years of service behind him, the only assistant she had ever had, his time at Paranor a mirror of her own. His stocky, gnarled body was still strong, but his movements were slowing and she could see the way he winced when his joints tightened and cramped after too much use. There was kindness in his eyes, and it had drawn her to him from the first, an indication of the nature of the man inside. Tagwen served because he respected what she was doing, what she meant to the Four Lands, and he never judged her by her successes or failures, even when there were so many more of the latter than the former.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Mistress,&#x201d; he said in his rough, gravel-laced voice, his seamed, bearded face dipping momentarily into shadow as he bowed. It was an odd, stiff gesture he had affected from the beginning. He leaned forward as if to share a confidence that others might try to overhear. &#x201c;Kermadec is here.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> She rose at once. &#x201c;He will not come inside,&#x201d; she said, making it a statement of fact.<br> &nbsp;<br> Tagwen shook his head. &#x201c;He waits at the north gate and asks if you will speak with him.&#x201d; The Dwarf&#x2019;s lips tightened in somber reflection. &#x201c;He says it is urgent.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> She reached for her cloak and threw it about her shoulders. She went by him, touching his shoulder reassuringly as she passed. She went out the door and down the hallway to begin her descent. Within the stairwell, beyond the sound of her own soft footfalls, she heard voices rise up from below, the sounds of conversations adrift on the air. She tried to make out what they said, but could not. They would be speaking of her; they did so almost incessantly. They would be asking why she continued as their leader, why she presumed that she could achieve anything after so many failures, why she could not recognize that her time was past and another should take her place. Some would be whispering that she ought to be forced out, one way or another. Some would be advocating stronger action.<br> &nbsp;<br> Druid intrigues. The halls of Paranor were rife with them, and she could not put a stop to it. At Walker&#x2019;s command, she had formed this Third Council on her return to the Four Lands from Parkasia. She had accepted her role as leader, her destiny as guide to those she had recruited, her responsibility for rebuilding the legacy of the Druids as knowledge givers to the Races. She had formed the heart of this new order with those few sent under duress by the Elven King Kylen Elessedil at his brother Ahren&#x2019;s insistence. Others had come from other lands and other Races, drawn by the prospect of exploring magic&#x2019;s uses. That had been twenty years ago, when there was fresh hope and everything seemed possible. Time and an inability to effect any measurable change in the thinking and attitudes of the governing bodies of those lands and Races had leeched most of that away. What remained was a desperate insistence on clinging to her belief that she was not meant to give up.<br> &nbsp;<br> But that alone was not enough. It would never be enough. Not for someone who had come out of darkness so complete that any chance at redemption had seemed hopeless. Not for Grianne Ohmsford, who had once been the Ilse Witch and had made herself Ard Rhys to atone for it.<br> &nbsp;<br> She reached the lower levels of the Keep, the great halls that connected the meeting rooms with the living quarters of those she had brought to Paranor. A handful of these Druids came into view, shadows sliding along the walls like spilled oil in the light of the flameless lamps that lit the corridors. Some nodded to her; one or two spoke. Most simply cast hurried glances and passed on. They feared and mistrusted her, these Druids she had accepted into her order. They could not seem to help themselves, and she could not find the heart to blame them.<br> &nbsp;<br> Terek Molt walked out of a room and grunted his unfriendly greeting, outwardly bold and challenging. But she could sense his real feelings, and she knew he feared her. Hated her more than feared her, though. It was the same with Traunt Rowan and Iridia Eleri and one or two more. Shadea a&#x2019;Ru was beyond even that, her venomous glances so openly hostile that there was no longer any communication between them, a situation that it seemed nothing could help.<br> &nbsp;<br> Grianne closed her eyes against what she was feeling and wondered what she was going to do about these vipers&#x2014;what she could do that would not have repercussions beyond anything she was prepared to accept.<br> &nbsp;<br> Young Trefen Morys passed her with a wave and a smile, his face guileless and welcoming, his enthusiasm evident. He was a bright light in an otherwise darkened firmament, and she was grateful for his presence. Some within the order still believed in her. She had never expected friendship or even compassion from those who came to her, but she had hoped for loyalty and a sense of responsibility toward the office she held. She had been foolish to think that way, and she no longer did so. Perhaps it was not inaccurate to say that now she merely hoped that reason might prevail.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Mistress,&#x201d; Gerand Cera greeted in his soft voice as he bowed her past him, his tall form lean and sinuous, his angular features sleepy and dangerous.<br> &nbsp;<br> There were too many of them. She could not watch out for all of them adequately. She put herself at risk every time she walked these halls &#x2014;here in the one place she should be safe, in the order she had founded. It was insane.<br> &nbsp;<br> She cleared the front hall and went out into the night, passed through a series of interconnected courtyards to the north gates, and ordered the guard to let her through. The Trolls on watch, impassive and silent, did as they were told. She did not know their names, only that they were there at Kermadec&#x2019;s behest, which was enough to keep her reassured of their loyalty. Whatever else happened in this steadily eroding company of the once faithful, the Trolls would stand with her.<br> &nbsp;<br> Would that prove necessary? She would not have thought so a month ago. That she asked the question now demonstrated how uncertain matters had become.<br> &nbsp;<br> She walked to the edge of the bluff, to the wall of trees that marked the beginning of the forest beyond, and stopped. An owl glided through the darkness, a silent hunter. She felt a sudden connection with him so strong that she could almost envision flying away as he did, leaving everything behind, returning to the darkness and its solitude.<br> &nbsp;<br> She brushed the thought aside, an indulgence she could not afford, and whistled softly. Moments later, a figure detached itself from the darkness almost in front of her and came forward.<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>Southwest : The Beautiful Cookbook</h2><p>Southwest the Beautiful Cookbook explores a cuisine as diverse as the terrain and the people who settled there.

Hood (American History/Hobart and William Smith Colleges) has researched his subject thoroughly: He comments knowledgeably on the geological composition of Manhattan and the surrounding terrain, and demonstrates how subterranean peculiarities affected the construction of the subway. He also shows how, from its beginning, New York's rapid transit was a pawn in the struggle to dominate the financial and political life of the metropolis--a struggle that included August Belmont's monopolization of municipal transportation as well as the Tweed Gang's corrupt control of licensing and labor, control that resulted in tunnel cave-ins and other misfortunes. But when Hood examines how the construction of the subways influenced the expansion of the city, he falters: It's no surprise that the establishment of a rapid and reliable mode of transportation between the city's workplaces and its outlying boroughs fostered the settlement of these previously inaccessible areas. Hood provides a few fresh insights, however, as when he analyzes the discriminatory practices that shaped the original development of the Jackson Heights section of Queens. And though he generally fails to leaven his statistics-heavy text (miles of track laid, number of passengers carried, amount of budget money allocated, etc.) with pertinent anecdotes, his story of class- conscious Vogue editor Edna Woodman Chase is winsome: Chase, upon learning that a member of her staff had flung himself in front of a subway train, said, ``[At Vogue], if we must kill [ourselves], we take sleeping pills.'' Of some interest to urban historians, but slow-going for general readers. (Sixteen pages of b&amp;w photographs--not seen) -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Since languages live, breathe, and change, antiquated terms must be excised and newly coined words included, definitions must take current usage into account, and editorial dreams of comprehensiveness vie with practical considerations of space. And that's when you're dealing with just one language. In a two-language dictionary such as this English-Spanish/Spanish-English college dictionary by Harper Collins, the task is more than doubled. Not only must both lexicons be evaluated for a scope and contemporary relevance consistent with a sophisticated audience, but the definitions and translations must be appropriate for students still learning Spanish.<p> It's a tough proposition, but Harper Collins is more than up to the task. With 355,000 entries and translations, the <i>Harper Collins Spanish College Dictionary</i> covers the basic building blocks of the two languages, plus thousands of contemporary technical, political, and business terms--such as karaoke, telemarketing, male menopause, and aromatherapy, downsize, spellchecker, carphone, and junk TV. While some words are translated simply and briefly with one-word or two-word definitions, such as "odioso/a" for "hateful," more complex words, such as "have," merit a full column of idioms, examples, and grammatical constructs. The entry for "head" (<i>cabeza</i>), for example, includes everything from "my head aches" (<i>me duele la cabeza</i>) to "laugh one's head off" (<i>reirse a carcajadas</i>) to "have a head for business" (<i>ser bueno para los negocios</i>).</p><p> In addition, a Language Building Supplement contains 85 pages of translation tips, sentence-builder templates, Spanish verbs, and correspondence models, plus numbers, times and dates, weights and measures, and vocabulary for the telephone. This 1,100-page tome provides the tools that can enable you to read, write, and speak correct, up-to-date Spanish. For the money, it would be hard to find a dictionary better suited to the needs of a serious student of Spanish. <i>--Stephanie Gold</i></p><p>HarperCollins Publishers</p></p><h2>Suzanne Somers&#39; Eat, Cheat, and Melt the Fat Away</h2><p>Find out how hundreds of thousands of people all across the country have melted the pounds away without dieting, without deprivation -- the Somersize way!<br><br>With her number one <i>New York Times</i> bestsellers <b>Eat Great, Lose Weight</b> and <b>Get Skinny on Fabulous Food</b>, Suzanne Somers spread the word about her revolutionary weight-loss program that's unlike any diet out there.

At the same time, development of the province's natural resources has put increasing pressure on traditional outport culture. To exacerbate matters, the last decade has witnessed a dying fishery, the lure of economic prosperity in the west, and the attraction of larger urban centres. As a result, outport communities are feeling the brunt of vast outmigration. Much of the distinct heritage that has characterized Newfoundland for so many years has changed drastically. However, the uniqueness of outports, nurtured by centuries of isolation, will always remain. <i>Outport</i> is a snapshot in time between the years 1969-1985, vividly capturing the life of one of these communities. Through dramatic photographs and personal stories told by the people themselves, this book takes a look back at a lifestyle that has changed forever.</p><p>Candace Cochrane first came to Newfoundland in 1967 to work in a children&#39;s summer recreation program run by the Quebec-Labrador Foundation (QLF) on the Northern Peninsula. The landscape and its people inspired her to develop her photography skills in order to document her experience of outport life. Since then, she has divided her time between working as a photojournalist, a teacher of photography, and a cultural heritage program director for QLF. Her photographs have appeared in numerous magazines and books in Canada and the US. Some of the photographs from this book are collected in the National Archives of Canada. For part of each year, Cochrane lives and works out of her house on the Northern Peninsula, where she first fell in love with the province of Newfoundland and Labrador.</p><h2>Soldier of Arete</h2><p><p>The second volume of Gene Wolfe's powerful story of Latro, a Roman mercenary who, while fighting in Greece, received a head injury that deprived him of his short-term memory. In return it gave him the ability to converse with supernatural creatures, gods and goddesses who invisibly inhabit the ancient landscape.</p></p><p>Wolfe's forgetful protagonist Latro continues the odyssey through classical Greece begun in Soldier of the Mist . Serving in King Xerxes's army during the Persian attempt to conquer Greece, in the fifth century B.C., Latro received an injury that makes him forget each day's events. In compensation, he records his experiences on a scroll, the ostensible text of this book. Now a Greek slave in the service of the shipmaster Hypereides, he travels from Sestos, after its fall, to Thrace, where he fights alongside Amazons, and onto the cities of Thought (Athens) and Rope (Sparta). Accompanied by the child Io, who calls herself his slave, and by a fellow captive soldier, Latro seeks to regain his friends, his memory and his freedom. One effect of his curse, or illness, is that he can see and speak with gods, mythical creatures and the dead. The shifting perspective provided by Latro's need to relearn his life and his world every day, with incidents and people portrayed in varying terms each time he writes about them, makes for a many-layered and complex narrative. It is virtually mandatory to read the first volume, although a synopsis here might have precluded the necessity. This is a rich book and a rewarding one for the persevering reader. <br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.Simultaneously cursed with the inability to remember his past and blessed with the ability to speak with gods, a soldier formerly in service to the Great King of Parsa (Persia) seeks answers to his many questions amid the fractured, war-torn landscape of the ancient world. Latro's second-hand view of reality lends a dreamlike quality to a story that mirrors the struggle of human consciousness to explain events beyond its comprehension. In this sequel to Soldier of the Mist, Wolfe achieves a rare blend of history and myth, forming a single shimmering vision of a world unmarked by modern preconceptions. Highly recommended.<br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Business As Unusual: My Entrepreneurial Journey, Profits With Principles</h2><p>Anita Roddick is one of the world's most outspoken, controversial, and successful entrepreneurs of the age. Her autobiography, <i>Business As Unusual</i>, charts the story of Roddick and her company The Body Shop through all the highs and lows since 1990. It also examines the parallel growth of vigilante consumerism and predicts how businesses can evolve in this millennium.<br> Roddick tackles a wide range of personal and political issues--from self-esteem to human rights abuses associated with globalization--and offers her own vision for dealing with the demands of an ethical economy. She proposes that the power of public pressure to create change must never be underestimated and argues that waves of public consciousness are steadily forcing corporations to re-evaluate their actions. By expanding the role and responsibility of the entrepreneur, as well as the definition of business ethics, the corporate world will be compelled to change. In this new edition Roddick brings the story up to date.</p><p><p>Dame Anita Roddick started The Body Shop in 1976 in Brighton, England. What distinguishes The Body Shop and Roddick from other global businesses and entrepreneurs is a core dedication to community trade and human rights. Roddick is a key pioneer of socially responsible business, proving that commerce with a conscience is not only a moral imperative. She was named a Dame of the Order of the British Empire in 2003.

If George Plimpton had muscles and had been choked out one too many times&#x2013;&#x2013;this is the book he could have written.</p><p> When Robinson and his fellow fighters mix it up, they live completely for the moment: absorbed in the feel of muscles slippery with sweat; the metallic tang of blood mingling with saliva in the mouth; the sweet, firm thud of taped knuckles impacting flesh. They fight because it feels good. They fight because they want to win. And even if they get their asses kicked, they fight because they love fighting.</p><p> Fight is part encyclopedia, part panegyric to fighting in all its forms and glory.

Every heroine is covered in a few brief, occasionally superficial paragraphs: a page or two about her life, another spread covering her era and milieu, and a third covering, in one case, ``Sacagawea's World,'' and in Harriet Tubman's case, ``Ole Chariot,'' with a few more details about escapes from slavery. The chapter on Lady Murasaki Shikibu, described as the author of ``the world's first novel'' (The Tale of Genji), consists of a few sentences on her life story, some commentary on Japanese court life and courting rituals, and general notes on medieval Japanese culture in general. The accompanying map shows sites in Japan that relate to Lady Murasaki's life and Genji, but, like the other maps in the book, is superficial and so primitively rendered as to be useless. The illustrations are another weak point, derivative and sometimes poorly drafted (Sir Francis Drake suffers from this, as does Earhart). The subjects are inherently fascinating, but the presentation is too simplistic to satisfy; the book feels packaged and won't whet readers' appetites for more information. (maps, further reading) (Biographies. 10+) -- <i>Copyright �1996, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>Grade 5-8-A wonderful introduction to a diverse group of 12 women, from ancient Greece to modern times. Each heroine receives a three-to-four page discussion, along with Hazell's period-style illustrations and a loosely drawn map. Facts, including cultural and historical background, are mixed with the author's informed suppositions. This is especially apparent in the entries describing subjects about whom little is known, such as Lady Murasaki Shikibu (author of The Tale of Genji) and Sacagawea. The chapter about Agnodice, an ancient Greek healer, is based on stories and legends and rounded out with a discussion of early medicine and a description of ancient Athens. Three modern women are also depicted: Anna Akhmatova, Madame Sun Yat-Sen (Soong Ching-ling), and Frida Kahlo. The other six heroines are well-known figures who have received a good amount of biographical attention: Eleanor of Aquitaine, Joan of Arc, Queen Elizabeth I, Harriet Tubman, Marie Curie, and Amelia Earhart. A helpful list for further reading, with adult and juvenile sources, is appended. Though limited as a research tool, this book uses well-chosen details and anecdotes to bring each subject to life.<br><i>Marilyn Taniguchi, Santa Monica Public Library, CA</i><br>Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Lonely Planet Sicily (Regional Guide)</h2><p><p><i>Lonely Planet: The world's leading travel guide publisher</i> </p><p><b><i>Lonely Planet</i></b> <b><i>Sicily</i> </b>is your passport to the most relevant, up-to-date advice on what to see and skip, and what hidden discoveries await you.

To engage in it Half-heartedly is an insult to God and man. Slumber must forsake our eyelids sooner than men shall be allowed to perish. Yet we are all prone to sleep as do others, and students, among the rest, are apt to act the part of the foolish virgins; therefore have I sought to speak out my whole soul, in the hope that I might not create or foster dullness in others. May he in whose hand are the churchess and their pastors bless these words to younger brethren in the ministry, and if so, Is shall count it more than a full reward and shall gratefully praise the Lord.---From Spurgeon's Lectures To My Students<br><br>Known as the "Prince of preachers," Charles Haddon Spurgeon (1834-1892) spent his entire life preaching. It is estimated that he preached six hundred sermons by his twentieth birthday and that during his lifetime he deliveered nearly thirty-six hundred sermons and preached to ten million people. His collected srmons (translated into numerous languagess even in his lifetime) remain one of the best-selling series in history. Christians and seekers throughout the world prize them for their biblical grounding, eloquent text, and simple encouragement to follow Christ.<br><br>Recognizing the importance of training men up as preachers, Spurgeon founded The Pastor's College in 1856, just six years after his conversion. It was Spurgeon's habit to lecture at the College every Friday afternoon, bringing his spiritual wisdom and practical experience into the classroom. His lectures are rich reservoirs of knowledge and insight, providing instruction, inspiration, illustrations, and resources for the aspiring preacher. Originally published in four volumes, these lectures reveal a book-lover who was extremely well-read, a communicator who understood the power of a well told story, and a man passionate about his life's calling.<br><br>Spurgeon's lectures are as powerful today as they were more than a century ago. Gently updated for the modern reader, this collection includes all of Spurgeon's lectures, including his often overlooked talks on "Commenting" and "Commentaries." This volume is a necessary addition to the library of every pastor, teacher, or evange-list desiring to be trained by the "Prince of Preachers" himself.</p><p>One contemporary scholar and authority on Spurgeon says of this work: &#39;Next to Mr. Spurgeon&#39;s great literary work, The Treasury of David, we consider (these) Lectures to My Students his greatest single contribution to the Christian world. There is more practical wisdom, common sense and sage advice packed within these pages than with any other book of similar size, or content.&#39; This complete and unabridged edition of Spurgeon&#39;s great work will make it possible for today&#39;s generation to appreciate Spurgeon&#39;s combination of discerning wit and refreshingly practical advice. Included in the twenty-eight chapters of this classic volume are lectures such as: - The Call to Ministry - The Preacher&#39;s Private Prayer - On the Choice of a Text - On the Voice - The Holy Spirit in Connection with Our Ministry - The Blind Eye and the Deaf Ear - On Conversion as Our Aim - Illustrations in Preaching As were all of Spurgeon&#39;s messages to his people, each of these lectures is Scripture-saturated and Christ-honoring. They move swiftly and are fascinating in their content and sage counsel.<p>Charles Haddon Spurgeon (1834-1892) served for 30 years at the Metropolitan Tabernacle in London. It is estimated that during his lifetime he spoke to 10 million people, and he became known as the "Prince of Preachers." His works fill over 60 volumes; and more than a century after his death, his sermons and devotional texts continue to challenge and touch Christians and non-Christians alike with their biblical grounding, eloquent text, and simple encouragement. Among his published books are "Lectures to My Students" (Hendrickson); "The Treasury of David" (Hendrickson), a devotional commentary on the Psalms; "All of Grace," the first Christian pocket-paperback published in the United States; numerous volumes of topical sermon collections; and the best-selling "Morning and Evening."</p></p><h2>Practical Math A Reference Guide And Problem Sets</h2><p>Brand new!

But when they did arrive, their orders were to put the Final Solution&#x201d; into effect with deliberate speed. Soros, a Jewish lawyer in Budapest, secured fake Christian identities for himself, his wife, and his two sons following the German invasion of Hungary on March 19, 1944. In a narrative reminiscent of the great Primo Levi, Soros recounts his experiences with a beguiling humor, deep humanity, and a wisdom that is humbling.<br><br> Superbly translated by Humphrey Tonkin, <i>Masquerade</i> is a unique account of how one man managed not only to survive but to retain his integrity, compassion, family unity, and humor by dancing around death.&#x201d; Like Klemperer&#x2019;s <i>Diary of the Nazi Years</i>, this very personal, low-key testament of the Holocaust is a gripping depiction of normal&#x201d; daily life under the Nazis told by a man who triumphed by leading an ordinary life under extraordinary and terrifying circumstances.</p><p><b>Tivadar Soros</b> was born in Budapest in the last decade of the nineteenth century. In 1956, at the time of the Hungarian revolution, he and his wife escaped to the West, where he lived in New York until his death in 1968.<br><br><b>Dr. Humphrey Tonkin</b> is University Professor of the Humanities and President Emeritus at the University of Hartford. He joined the university in January 1989 and served as president for almost ten years, returning to teaching and research in June 1998.

He is the author of several best-selling books, most recently <i>The New Paradigm for Financial Markets</i>. He was born in Budapest and lives in New York City.A hopeful book about the Holocaust is a rare find. Billionaire financier George Soros, the author's son, is known for his optimistic, bold philanthropical support of open societies in post-Communist Eastern Europe. After reading this sober but surprisingly cheerful memoir, it's clear where George got these traits. Few Holocaust memoirs begin with statements like "Life is beautiful and full of variety and adventure. But luck must be on your side." But survival took wiles and connections as well. As life worsened for Hungarian Jews in 1944, Soros, a Budapest lawyer, managed to find false Christian papers and hiding places for his family. The Soroses struggled daily against possible discovery and death. Soros relates the fascinating details of his search for hiding places and skilled document forgers. The book's remarkable, upbeat tone predominates: even as Hungary falls to homegrown fascists and his acquaintances are killed, Soros views his travails as a game he will win. The book is a tribute to the power of the individual to maneuver through devastating, dangerous circumstances. Originally published in Esperanto in 1965 (the author died in 1986), the book was recently rediscovered by Paul Soros's daughter-in-law. Those interested in the Holocaust and in the psychology of survival will find it compelling, as will those seeking inspiration. Eight pages b&amp;w photos not seen by PW. (Sept.)

Narrated by an unnamed boy, it introduces Victor, an orange octopus who "slithered out of his cave in Puget Sound" to take in the nearby sights. Attaching himself, as it were, to the boy's family, the tentacled invertebrate climbs Mount Rainier, goes to the zoo and, clad in human clothes, poses as the narrator's cousin at elementary school. Victor's too-numerous, outlandish activities so lack (even picture-book) believability and purpose that reader attention wanes; in fact, the most stimulating passages here feature authentic, undersea octopus behavior rather than convoluted fantasies. Beatific smiles proliferate (even trees are grinning), and a somewhat garish, though not unappealing, palette of primarily aqua, bright pinks and deep yellows colors each illustration.

People don&#x2019;t just compete, however; they also cooperate. John Roemer argues that attempts by orthodox game theorists to account for cooperation leave much to be desired. Unlike competing players, cooperating players take those actions that they would like others to take&#x2014;which Roemer calls &#x201c;Kantian optimization.&#x201d; Through rigorous reasoning and modeling, Roemer demonstrates a simpler theory of cooperative behavior than the standard model provides.</p><p><b>John E.

He is the author of several books, including <i>Sustainability for a Warmer Planet</i>; <i>Democracy, Education, and Equality;</i><i>Political Competition: Theory and Applications</i>; and <i>Equality of Opportunity.</i>"John Roemer proves in this book that one can still write an original and innovative book using formal models and yet focus on really essential economic ideas."&#x2014;Ariel Rubinstein, Tel Aviv University and New York University<br>"In this striking book, Roemer expands on his earlier idea of Kantian reasoning to provide a new and different view of social preferences that is well illustrated by examples and applications."&#x2014;David K.

After organizing a successful World Cup in 2006 and winning it against Argentina in Brazil in 2014, Germany sees a note of confidence, even triumphalism, permeating the country. As a European leader committed to the success of the EU and the Eurozone, Germany is a leading driver of European affairs. It emerged from the recession of 2008 as the strongest economic power in Europe, and German manufacturing, product brand value, and exports are going from strength to strength. &nbsp; What are the implications of this new world confidence for German society itself? In the last few years we have seen East and West Germany come together socially and achieve a greater degree of economic balance as a long-term result of German re-unification. At the same time German society itself is internationalizing, with increased immigration and the adaptation of age-old values and attitudes to a multinational, multicultural era. Traditional attitudes of formality and rigid protocol in business are softening as German business globalizes. This new, updated edition of<i> Culture Smart! Germany</i> examines these changes. It explains how German traditional values and working methods are adapting to take advantage of international opportunities and global society while maintaining the commitment to quality, organization, and time that marks out German business life. It shows how the traditional differences between Germany&#x2019;s regions are lessening, enabling society to come together and better absorb new immigrants, and above all how Germans are losing the fear and guilt associated with their twentieth-century wars and finding a new voice on the international stage.</p><p><b>Barry Tomalin, M.A.</b> is Lecturer in International Communication and Cultures at the London Academy of Diplomacy.

It is about three meters long, and rests comfortably in a steel frame surrounded by wires, pipes and dials. At first glance, the entire contraption looks like the inside of a giant car engine. In fact, it is a clock -- or, rather, <i>the</i> clock. The Bonn device, and a network of similar instruments across the world, together constitute "the standard clock." The individual instruments, of which the German model is currently the most accurate, are cesium-beam atomic clocks. They are continually monitored, compared, tweaked and refined via radio signals from satellites and television stations, to cajole them into near-perfect step. At the International Bureau of Weights and Measures at S�vres, not far from Paris, the data are collected, analyzed and broadcast to a time-obsessed world. Thus originates the famous pips, the radio time signals by which we set our watches.<br><br>So, as we go about our daily toil, the Bonn cesium-beam clock keeps the time. It is, so to speak, a custodian of Earth time. The trouble is, the Earth itself doesn't always keep good time. Occasionally our clocks, all supposedly linked to the master system in France like a retinue of obedient slaves, must be adjusted by a second to track changes in the Earth's rotation rate. The last such "leap second" was added on 30 June 1994. The planet's spin, accurate enough to serve as a perfectly suitable clock for a thousand generations, is now defunct as a reliable chronometer. In this age of high-precision timekeeping, poor old Earth doesn't make the grade. Only an atomic clock, man-made and mysterious, serves to deliver those all-important tick-tocks with the precision demanded by navigators, astronomers and airline pilots. One second is no longer defined to be 1/86,400 of a day: it is 9,192,631,770 beats of a cesium atom.<br><br>But whose time is the Bonn clock telling anyway? Your time? My time? God's time? Are the scientists in that cluttered laboratory monitoring the pulse of the universe, fastidiously tracking some abstract cosmic time with atomic fidelity? Might there be another clock, perhaps on another planet somewhere, faithfully ticking out another time altogether, to the joy of its makers?<br><br>We know clocks need not agree: the Earth clock gets out of sync with the Bonn clock. So which one is <i>right?</i> Well, presumably the Bonn clock, because it's more accurate. But accurate relative to <i>what?</i> To <i>us?</i> After all, clocks were invented to tell the time for entirely human purposes. Are all humans "on" the same time, however? The patient in the dentist's chair and the audience listening to a Beethoven symphony experience the same atomically tagged duration in quite different ways.<br><br>So much of what we believe about time is a result of cultural conditioning. I once met a mystic in Bombay who claimed he could alter his state of consciousness through meditation and so suspend the flow of time altogether; he was unimpressed with talk of atomic clocks. In a lecture in London some years ago, I found myself sharing the platform improbably with the Dalai Lama. Our task was to compare and contrast time as it enters into Western scientific thinking and Eastern philosophy. The Lama spoke with quiet assurance, but unfortunately in Tibetan. Though I tried to follow the translation for enlightenment, I didn't receive much, regrettably. Culture clash, I suppose.<br><br>After my lecture, we had a tea break, and the Dalai Lama took my hand as we walked out of the building into the sunshine. Someone dropped to his knees and presented His Holiness with a daffodil, which he graciously accepted. I had the overwhelming impression of a gentle and intelligent man with insights of value to us all, but prevented by the trappings of his office from effectively communicating them to the assembled Western scientists. I came away from the occasion with a deep sense of missed opportunity.<br><br><b>THE QUEST FOR ETERNITY</b><br><br><i>Eternity? thou pleasing, dreadful thought?</i><br><br>Joseph Addison<br><br>In the madcap world of modern Western society, where time is money, railways, airline schedules, television programs, even cooking are subject to the tyranny of the clock.

Running like a common thread through the history of human thought, East and West, North and South, is a belief that the entire paradigm of human temporality is rooted in some sort of monstrous illusion; it is but an elaborate product of the human mind:<br><br><i>And likewise time cannot itself exist,<br><br>But from the flight of things we get a sense of time....<br><br>No man, we must confess, feels time itself,<br><br>But only knows of time from flight or rest of things.</i><br><br>Thus wrote the Roman poet-philosopher Lucretius in his first-century epic <i>De Rerum Natura.</i> From such unsettling ideas it is but a small step to believe that the passage of time can be controlled or even suspended by mental power, as we discover in the following haunting words of the sixteenth-century mystical poet Angelus Silesius:<br><br><i>Time is of your own making,<br><br>its clock ticks in your head.<br><br>The moment you stop thought<br><br>time too stops dead.</i><br><br>For such temporal relativists, true reality is vested in a realm that transcends time: the Land Beyond Time. Europeans call it "eternity," Hindus refer to it as "moksha" and Buddhists as "nirvana." For the Australian aborigines it is the Dream Time. Angelus Silesius again:<br><br><i>Do not compute eternity<br>as light-year after year<br>One step across<br>that line called Time<br>Eternity is here.</i><br><br>In our struggle to come to terms with mental and physical reality, nothing vexes us more than the nature of time. The paradoxical conjunction of temporality and eternity has troubled Man through the ages. Plato concluded that the fleeting world of daily experience is only half real, an ephemeral reflection of a timeless domain of pure and perfect Forms, which occupy the realm of eternity. Time itself is but an imperfect "moving image of Eternity which remains forever at one," but which we human beings incorrigibly reify: "The past and future are created species of time, which we unconsciously but wrongly transfer to the eternal essence.<br><br>The abiding tension between the temporal and the eternal pervades the world's great religions, and has led to generations of heated and sometimes violent theological debate. Is God inside or outside of time? Temporal or eternal? Process or Being? According to Plotinus, a third-century pagan, to exist in time is to exist imperfectly. Pure Being (i.e., God) must therefore be characterized by the utter absence of any relation to time. For Plotinus, time represents a prison for human beings, separating us from the divine realm -- the true and absolute reality.<br><br>Belief that God lies outside of time altogether also became the established doctrine among many early Christian thinkers, such as Augustine, Boethius and Anselm, starting a tradition that continues to the present day. Like Plato and Plotinus before him, Augustine places God in the realm of eternity, "supreme above time because it is a never-ending present." In this existence, time does not pass; rather, God perceives all times at once:<br><br>Your years are completely present to you all at one because they are at a permanent standstill. They do not move on, forced to give way before the advance of others, because they never pass at all...Your today is eternity.<br><br>Thus, the God of classical Christianity not only exists outside of time, but also knows the future as well as the past and present. These farreaching ideas have been subjected to detailed analysis and received some sharp criticism by the medieval church, as well as by modern theologians and philosophers. The core of the debate is the daunting problem of how to build a bridge between God's presumed eternity on the one hand and the manifest temporality of the physical universe on the other. Can a god who is completely atemporal logically relate in any way at all to a changing world, to human time? Surely it is impossible for God to exist <i>both</i> within and outside of time? After centuries of bitter debate, there is still no consensus among theologians about the solution to this profound conundrum. These tangled issues are reviewed in greater depth in my book <i>The Mind of God,</i> for those readers who are interested.<br><br><b>ESCAPE FROM TIME</b><br><br><i>The great thing about time is that it goes on.</i><br><br>Arthur Eddington<br><br>Although theologians and philosophers wrangle over the technicalities of the logical relationship between time and eternity, many religious people believe that the most powerful insights into the subject are provided, not by academic debate, but by direct revelation:<br><br>I remember that I was going to bathe from a stretch of shingle to which the few people who stayed in the village seldom went. Suddenly the noise of the insects was hushed. Time seemed to stop. A sense of infinite power and peace came upon me. I can best liken the combination of timelessness with amazing fullness of existence to the feeling one gets in watching the rim of a great silent fly-wheel or the unmoving surface of a deep, strongly-flowing river. Nothing happened: yet existence was completely full. All was clear.<br><br>This personal story, recounted by the physicist and Anglican bishop Ernest Barnes in his 1929 Gifford Lectures, eloquently captures the combination of timelessness and clarity so often said to be associated with mystical or religious experiences. Can a human being really escape time and glimpse eternity? In Barnes's case, as happens so often in reports from Westerners, the experience came totally out of the blue. But Eastern mystics have perfected special techniques that allegedly can induce such timeless rapture. The Tibetan monk Lama Govinda describes his own experiences thus:<br><br>The temporal sequence is converted into a simultaneous co-existence, the side-by-side existence of things into a state of mutual interpenetration...a living continuum in which time and space are integrated.<br><br>Many similar descriptions have been published of deep meditation, or even drug-induced mental states, in which human consciousness apparently escapes the confines of time, and reality appears as a timeless continuum.<br><br>The Indian philosopher Ruth Reyna believes the Vedic sages "had cosmic insights which modern man lacks...Theirs was the vision not of the present, but of the past, present, future, simultaneity, and No-Time." Sankara, the eighth-century exponent of Advaita Vedanta, taught that Brahma -- the Absolute -- is perfect and eternal in the sense of <i>absolute timelessness,</i> and thus the temporal, though real within the world of human experience, has no ultimate reality. By following the path of Self-Realization through Advaita, a truly timeless reality may be attained: "timeless not in the sense of endless duration, but in the sense of completeness, requiring neither a before nor an after," according to Reyna. "It is this astounding truth that time evaporates into unreality and Timelessness may be envisioned as the Real...that spells the uniqueness of Advaita."<br><br>The yearning for an escape from time need not involve refined meditative practices. In many cultures it is merely a pervasive yet subconscious influence -- a "terror of history," as anthropologist Mircea Eliade expresses it -- which manifests itself as a compulsive search for the Land Beyond Time. Indeed, this search is <i>the</i> founding myth of almost all human cultures. The deep human need to account for the origin of things draws us irresistibly back to a time before time, a mythical realm of timeless temporality, a Garden of Eden, a primordial paradise, its potent creativity springing from its very temporal contradictions. Whether it is Athena leaping from the head of Zeus or Mithras slaying the Bull, we encounter the same heady symbolism of a lost, timeless, perfect realm that somehow -- paradoxically, timelessly -- stands in creative relation to the immediate world of the temporal and the mortal.<br><br>This paradoxical conjunction is captured in its most developed form in the "Dreaming" concept of the Australian aborigines, sometimes referred to as the Eternal Dream Time. According to the anthropologist W. E. H. Stanner:<br><br>A central meaning of The Dreaming is that of a sacred, heroic time long, long ago when man and nature came to be as they are; but neither "time" nor "history" as we understand them is involved in this meaning. I have never been able to discover any aboriginal word for <i>time</i> as an abstract concept. And the sense of "history" is wholly alien here. We shall not understand The Dreaming fully except as a complex of meanings.<br><br>Although the Dream Time carries connotations of a heroic past age, it is wrong to think of that age as now over. "One cannot 'fix' The Dreaming in time," observes Stanner. "It was, and is, everywhen." Thus the Dreaming retains a relevance in contemporary aboriginal affairs, because it is part of the present reality; the "creator beings" are still active today. What Europeans call "the past" is, for many aboriginal people, <i>both</i> past and present. Stories of creation are often cast in what Europeans would call the recent past, even as recent as the era of white settlement. No incongruity is felt, because, for the Australian aborigine, events are more important than dates. This subtlety is lost on most European minds; we have become obsessed with rationalizing and measuring time in our everyday lives. Stanner quotes an old Australian black man who expressed this cultural gulf lyrically:<br><br><i>White man got no dreaming<br><br>Him go 'nother way.<br><br>White man, him go different,<br><br>Him got road belong himself.</i><br><br>The concept of "white man's time" as a "road" down which he marches single-mindedly is an especially apt description, I think, of Western linear time. It is a road that may perhaps lead to progress, but the psychological price we pay for embarking upon it is a heavy one. Fear of death lies at the root of so much we do and think, and with it the desperate desire to optimize the precious duration we have been allotted, to lead life to the full and accomplish something of enduring value. Modern man, wrote J. B. Priestley,<br><br>...feels himself fastened to a hawser that is pulling him inexorably toward the silence and darkness of the grave...But no idea of an "eternal dream time," where gods and heroes (from whom he is not separated for ever) have their being, comes shining through to make modern man forget his calendars and clocks, the sands of his time running out.<br><br>But even those of us who are trapped within Western culture, for whom a magical, mystical escape route from time is unavailable, can still discern the powerful ancient symbols at work in art and literature, reverberating down the ages. From <i>Paradise Lost</i> to <i>Narnia,</i> from King Arthur's Avalon to that distant galaxy far away and long ago where the <i>Star Wars</i> were fought and won, the realm of eternity has never been very far from the surface. The evocative emblems of eternity now lay shadowy and indistinct in our culture, serving merely as a seductive distraction from the commonsense "reality" of ruthless, passing time....</p><h2>New England Legends and Folklore</h2><p>This handsome collection of lore and folktales takes the reader back to the days of early New England and such legends as the last highwayman, the double-headed snake, the charter oak, and the witchcraft tragedy.</p><p><p>Native New Englander Samuel Adams Drake (1833-1905) was a journalist and author of many popular histories including Old Landmarks of Boston, Heart of the White Mountains, The Making of New England, and The Battle of Gettysburg.

I came up from miles below the surface and opened an eye as one part of my brain tried to work out what had disturbed me and another part focused on how to make the noise stop. It resolved into a low rattle that was my phone vibrating crossly on the bedside table along with the high-pitched shrill of the most annoying ring tone I could have chosen. Fumbling for it in the dark, I sideswiped it and managed to push it off the table. It fell face down in the carpet, still ringing, the sound now slightly muffled. I&#x2019;d winged it but not killed it. The bonus was that now it was a little bit harder to reach. I leaned out of bed at a dangerous angle, raking the carpet with my fingers, trying to get to it.</p><p>&#x2018;Mmph!&#x2019;</p><p>Most of the nuance was lost in the pillow, but I interpreted Ian&#x2019;s comment as &#x2018;answer the fucking phone&#x2019;, which was pretty much what I was thinking myself. Along <i>with what time is it</i>? and <i>what does this eejit want</i>?</p><p>I got it at last and stabbed at the buttons until it stopped making a noise, trying to read the screen. LANGTON. Rob. I squinted at the time and read 03.27. Half past three in the morning and Detective Constable Rob Langton was calling me. I was waking up now, my brain starting to crank into gear, but my mouth hadn&#x2019;t caught up with the change of plans and was still slack with sleep. When I said hello, it sounded slurred, as if I&#x2019;d been drinking for the last&#x2014;I worked it out&#x2014;three and a half hours instead of having some much-needed shut-eye. Three and a half hours. That made six hours of sleep in the last forty-eight. I squeezed my eyes closed and wished I hadn&#x2019;t added it up. Somehow, knowing the numbers made me feel worse.</p><p>&#x2018;Did I wake you, Kerrigan?&#x2019; I would have recognised the Manchester twang anywhere.</p><p>&#x2018;You know you did. What do you want?&#x2019;</p><p>I asked, but I already knew. There were only two reasons why Rob Langton would be ringing me at that hour of the morning sounding excited. One: there was another body. Two: they&#x2019;d caught the killer. Either way, I wasn&#x2019;t going back to sleep any time soon.</p><p>&#x2018;Got him.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;No way.&#x2019; I sat up in bed and put the light on, ignoring a groan from beside me and squinting as I tried to concentrate. &#x2018;Where? How?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;We had a bit of help. Nice young lady out on the beers with a bladed article didn&#x2019;t take kindly to being next on the Burning Man&#x2019;s list.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;He&#x2019;s not dead.&#x2019; My heart was pounding. If he was dead, that was it. No answers. No trial.</p><p>No justice.</p><p>&#x2018;Nah, he&#x2019;s clinging on. He&#x2019;s in hospital. In surgery, at the minute. Two stab wounds to the abdomen; she lacerated his bowel.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Ouch.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Yeah, couldn&#x2019;t happen to a nicer person.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Anyone we know?&#x2019; I rubbed my eyes with the heel of my hand and tried not to yawn.</p><p>&#x2018;Not known at all. Never been arrested before, and he hadn&#x2019;t come up in this enquiry.&#x2019;</p><p>I sighed. That wasn&#x2019;t great news. We hadn&#x2019;t even been close to catching him, then. We&#x2019;d just been lucky. Though the girl had been luckier still. I wasn&#x2019;t a fan of people wandering around carrying knives, but I&#x2019;d seen enough dead women in the past few weeks to think it wasn&#x2019;t such a bad idea.</p><p>&#x2018;His name&#x2019;s Vic Blackstaff. He had all his documents on him&#x2014;driver&#x2019;s licence, work ID. He&#x2019;s in his mid-fifties, does shift work for a call centre in Epsom. Lives in Peckham. Drives through south-west London to get home in the small hours of the morning. Plenty of opportunity.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Older than we&#x2019;d thought,&#x2019; I commented. &#x2018;Shift work fits, though. Where did it happen?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Richmond.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;That&#x2019;s quite a long way out of the usual area. Up to now he&#x2019;s stuck to Kennington, Stockwell&#x2014;nowhere as far out as Richmond.&#x2019; I was frowning.</p><p>&#x2018;Yeah, but his usual area is flooded with uniforms. Makes sense that he would be hunting elsewhere, doesn&#x2019;t it?&#x2019; Rob sounded confident and I gave a mental shrug; who was I to second-guess a serial killer?</p><p>&#x2018;They&#x2019;re going through his car at the moment,&#x2019; Rob went on. &#x2018;We&#x2019;re waiting at the hospital.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Who&#x2019;s we?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Me and the boss. And DI Judd, unfortunately. We&#x2019;ll be interviewing the young lady as soon as the doctors tell us we can talk to her. She&#x2019;s still being checked out.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;How is she? Is she&#x2014;&#x2019;</p><p>I didn&#x2019;t want to fill in the rest of the sentence. Is she going to make it? Is she badly beaten? Is she burned? How far had he got?</p><p>&#x2018;She&#x2019;s fine. Shaken up. Nothing wrong with her but we haven&#x2019;t been allowed in to see her yet. She says she&#x2019;s not ready.&#x2019; Rob sounded impatient, which nettled me. Why shouldn&#x2019;t she take her time before speaking to the police? She&#x2019;d had a shock. What she needed was a sympathetic ear. And I was the ideal person to provide it. Energy flooded through my limbs, adrenalin pushing fatigue into a corner, to be ignored until I had time to give in to it again. Three hours&#x2019; sleep was plenty. I was already out of bed, making for the door, stumbling on rubbery legs that ached as if I&#x2019;d run a marathon the day before.</p><p>&#x2018;Well, I&#x2019;ll be there soon. Maybe they&#x2019;ll let me talk to her.&#x2019; The perks of being the only woman in Superintendent Godley&#x2019;s inner circle were not legion, but now and then it came in handy.</p><p>&#x2018;Why doesn&#x2019;t that surprise me? Nought to sixty in ten minutes, that&#x2019;s you.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;That&#x2019;s why you phoned me, isn&#x2019;t it?&#x2019; I was in the bathroom now, and debated whether I could risk peeing while on the phone. He&#x2019;d hear. I&#x2019;d have to wait.</p><p>&#x2018;I knew you&#x2019;d want to be here.&#x2019; That was only half the story; it suited them all for me to be there. I could hear Rob grinning; he was a smug git sometimes, but I could forgive him, because when all was said and done, I did want to be there, and without a call from him, I wouldn&#x2019;t have known a thing about it until I&#x2019;d seen it on the news.</p><p>&#x2018;Which hospital?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Kingston.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;I&#x2019;ll be there in half an hour,&#x2019; I said before I&#x2019;d thought about it properly. It was a long way from Primrose Hill to Kingston and I desperately needed a shower. My hair was sticking to my head. There was no way I was leaving with dirty hair. Not again. &#x2018;Make that forty minutes.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;We&#x2019;re in the ICU. Phones off, so ring the hospital if you need us.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Will do.&#x2019;</p><p>I flicked the water on before going to the loo, but even so, it wasn&#x2019;t even close to warm enough when I forced myself to step into the slate-lined shower area, wincing as the spray hit my goose-pimpled skin. The showerhead was the size of a dinner plate and pumped out rain-forest levels of water; it was just a shame that it never got hot enough for me. Style over substance, as usual. But it wasn&#x2019;t my flat so I couldn&#x2019;t really complain. I was sharing it, officially, but I felt more like a guest. And not necessarily a welcome one, at times.</p><p>I had balled my hands together under my chin, hugging body heat to myself, and it was an effort to unknot my fingers and reach for the shampoo once the water started to approach tepidity. Haste made me fumble the shampoo cap and I swore as I heard it skitter around the sloping tiles that led to the drain. I left it there, hearing my mother&#x2019;s voice in my head, <i>sure, it can&#x2019;t fall any further</i>...Two minutes later, I stepped on it and had to muffle a yelp in the crook of my elbow as a sharp edge dug into the arch of my foot. Swearing was a help. I swore. A lot.</p><p>I scrubbed at my scalp until the muscles in my forearms complained and rinsed my hair for as long as I could allow myself to, eyes closed against the lather that slid down my face. Bliss to be clean again, joy to know that the case was coming to an end. I wanted to stay in there for ever with my eyes closed; I wanted to sleep&#x2014;how I wanted to sleep. But I couldn&#x2019;t. I had to get going. And by the time I got out of the shower, I was what passed for awake these days.</p><p>Back in the bedroom, I tried to be quiet, but I couldn&#x2019;t help rattling the hangers in the wardrobe when I was taking out a suit. I heard stirring behind me in the bed and bit my lip.</p><p>&#x2018;What&#x2019;s up?&#x2019;</p><p>I wouldn&#x2019;t have spoken to Ian if he hadn&#x2019;t spoken to me; that was the rule I observed about getting up and leaving in the middle of the night. Not that I was sure he&#x2019;d ever noticed there was a rule.</p><p>&#x2018;Going to meet a murderer.&#x2019;</p><p>That earned me an opened eye. &#x2018;You got him. Well done.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;It wasn&#x2019;t exactly all my own work, but thanks.&#x2019;</p><p>He rolled over onto his back and threw an arm over his face, shielding his eyes from the light. He was in his natural position now, hogging the middle of the bed. I suppressed the impulse to push him back onto his own side and hauled the sheet up instead, tucking him in. <i>Look, I care about you. See how thoughtful I am.</i></p><p>&#x2018;Mmm,&#x2019; was the response. He was on his way back to sleep. I slipped the dry-cleaner&#x2019;s bag off my suit and balled it up, squashing it into the bin. I should have taken it off sooner. The suit smelled of chemicals and I wrinkled my nose, reluctant to put it on. The forecast was for a cold day, and rain. I thought longingly of jeans tucked into boots, of chunky jumpers and long knitted scarves. God, dressing like a grown-up was a pain.</p><p>I sat on the edge of the bed to deal with my tights, coaxing them over damp skin, wary of ripping them. My hair dripped onto my shoulders, cold water running down my back. I hadn&#x2019;t got time for this. I hadn&#x2019;t got time for immaculate. Slowly, infinitely slowly, I worked the material up over my thighs and stood to haul the tights the rest of the way. It was not the most elegant moment of getting dressed, and I wasn&#x2019;t pleased to turn and find Ian staring at me, an unreadable expression on his face.</p><p>&#x2018;So is this it?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;What do you mean?&#x2019; I slipped on a shirt, then stepped into my skirt, zipping it up quickly and smoothing it over my hips. That was better. More dignified. The waistband was loose, I noticed, the skirt hanging from my hips rather than my waist. It took the hem from on the knee to over it, from flattering to frump. I needed to eat more. I needed to rest.</p><p>&#x2018;I mean is this the end of it? Are you going to be around more?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Probably. Not for a little while&#x2014;we&#x2019;ve got to sort out the paperwork and get the case ready for the CPS. But after that, yeah.&#x2019;</p><p><i>If there isn&#x2019;t another serial killer waiting to take over from where the Burning Man left off. If nothing else goes wrong between now and Christmas. If all the criminals in London take the rest of the year off.</i></p><p>I was looking for shoes, my medium-heeled courts that didn&#x2019;t so much as nod to fashion but hey, I could wear them from now until midnight without a twinge of complaint from my feet. I could even run in them if I had to. One was in the corner of the room, where I&#x2019;d kicked it off. The other I eventually found under the bed, and had to sprawl inelegantly to retrieve it.</p><p>&#x2018;I hate the way they whistle and you come running.&#x2019; He sounded wide awake now, and cross. My heart sank.</p><p>&#x2018;It&#x2019;s my job.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Oh, it&#x2019;s your <i>job</i>. Sorry. I didn&#x2019;t realise.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Don&#x2019;t do this now,&#x2019; I said, stabbing my feet into my shoes and grabbing my towel. &#x2018;I&#x2019;ve got to go. It&#x2019;s important and you know it.&#x2019;</p><p>He&#x2019;d sat up, leaning on one elbow, blue eyes hostile under thick eyebrows, his brown hair uncharacteristically untidy. &#x2018;What I know is that I haven&#x2019;t seen you for weeks. What I know is that I&#x2019;ll be ringing up Camilla to say you can&#x2019;t come to supper after all, and is that OK, and I&#x2019;m really sorry if it&#x2019;s mucked up her seating arrangement. What I know is that your job always seems to come first.&#x2019;</p><p>I let him rant, towelling most of the water out of my hair and then dragging a comb through it, trying to get it into some sort of order. No time to dry it; it would dry on the way to the hospital. A few wisps, a lighter brown than the rest, were already curling around my face.</p><p>&#x2018;Camilla works in an art gallery. She has nothing to do all day but rearrange the seating plan for her little dinner parties. It&#x2019;ll be a challenge for her.&#x2019;</p><p>He flopped back down and stared at the ceiling. &#x2018;You always do that.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;What?&#x2019; I shouldn&#x2019;t have asked.</p><p>&#x2018;Put down my friends because their jobs aren&#x2019;t as important or as worthwhile as yours.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;For God&#x2019;s sake...&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Not everyone wants to save the world, Maeve.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Yeah, it&#x2019;s just as important to make it look nice,&#x2019; I snapped, and regretted it as soon as I&#x2019;d said it. Camilla was sweet, sincere, a wide-eyed innocent that brought out the protective instinct in everyone who knew her, including me. Usually. The sharpness in my voice had been partly exhaustion and partly guilt; I <i>had</i> been thinking of skipping the dinner party she was throwing. It wasn&#x2019;t that I didn&#x2019;t like Ian&#x2019;s friends&#x2014;it was just that I couldn&#x2019;t stand the questions. <i>Any interesting cases lately? Why haven&#x2019;t you caught the Burning Man yet? What&#x2019;s the most hideous thing you&#x2019;ve ever seen on duty? Do you wish they still had capital punishment? Can you sort out this speeding ticket for me?</i> It was tedious and predictable and I found it acutely embarrassing to represent the Metropolitan Police to Ian&#x2019;s friends. I was just one person. And traffic tickets were definitely outside my purview.</p><p>&#x2018;Ian...&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Aren&#x2019;t you in a hurry?&#x2019;</p><p>I checked my watch. &#x2018;Yes. Let&#x2019;s talk about this later, OK?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Can&#x2019;t wait.&#x2019;</p><p>I wanted to point out that I hadn&#x2019;t brought it up in the first place. Instead, I leaned across the bed and planted a kiss on the bit of Ian&#x2019;s chin I could reach easily. There was no response. With a sigh, I headed to the kitchen to pick up a banana, then grabbed my bag and my coat and ran down the stairs. I closed the front door with the key in the lock so I didn&#x2019;t wake the neighbours, though if they&#x2019;d slept through my shower and relationship issues, they probably wouldn&#x2019;t notice the door banging. If they were at home, and not on a pre-Christmas shopping trip to New York or a winter break in the Bahamas.</p><p>I stopped for a second on the doorstep, head down, my mind whirling.</p><p>&#x2018;What am I doing? What the hell am I doing?&#x2019;</p><p>I hadn&#x2019;t meant to say it out loud, and I wasn&#x2019;t talking about work. I could handle work. My boyfriend was another matter. We&#x2019;d been together for eight months, lived together for six, and from the moment I&#x2019;d moved into Ian&#x2019;s place, the fighting had started. I&#x2019;d fallen for a big smile, broad shoulders and a job that had nothing to do with crime. He&#x2019;d told me he liked the dynamic, busy detective with long legs and no ulterior motives. I wasn&#x2019;t looking for a husband who could be the father to my children&#x2014;yet. My eyes didn&#x2019;t light up with pound signs when I heard he was in banking. It was all so easy. We saw one another when we could, snatched hours in bed at his place or mine, managed dinner together every so often and when my lease came up for renewal, Ian had taken a chance, the sort of gamble that had made him rich, and invited me to move in with him in his ludicrously over-designed, expensive flat in Primrose Hill. It hadn&#x2019;t been a good idea. It had been a disaster. And I wasn&#x2019;t sure how to get out of it. After two months, we hadn&#x2019;t known one another, except in the biblical sense. We hadn&#x2019;t worked out what we had in common, or how we might spend long winter afternoons when the weather made going out an unappealing prospect. As it turned out, we stayed in bed or we fought. There was no middle ground. I started to stay longer at work, left earlier in the morning, popped into the nick over the weekend even if I wasn&#x2019;t on duty. The only silver lining was the overtime pay.</p><p>The night air was harsh and I shivered as I hurried down the road, my hair cold against my neck.

Written as an afterword to this work, Concluding Unscientific Postscript is on one level a philosophical jest, yet on another it is Climacus's characterization of the subjective thinker's relation to the truth of Christianity. At once ironic, humorous, and polemical, this work takes on the "unscientific" form of a mimical-pathetical-dialectical compilation of ideas. Whereas the movement in the earlier pseudonymous writings is away from the aesthetic, the movement in Postscript is away from speculative thought. Kierkegaard intended Postscript to be his concluding work as an author. The subsequent "second authorship" after The Corsair Affair made Postscript the turning point in the entire authorship. Part One of the text volume examines the truth of Christianity as an objective issue, Part Two the subjective issue of what is involved for the individual in becoming a Christian, and the volume ends with an addendum in which Kierkegaard acknowledges and explains his relation to the pseudonymous authors and their writings. The second volume contains the scholarly apparatus, including a key to references and selected entries from Kierkegaard's journals and papers.</p></p><p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: Danish"The definitive edition of the <i>Writings</i>.

Robert Oppenheimer's Los Alamos. Peierls was a major participant in the revolutionary development of quantum mechanics in the 1920s and 1930s, working with some of the pioneers and, as he puts it, "some of the great characters" in this field.</p><p>Originally published in 1985.</p><p>The <b>Princeton Legacy Library</b> uses the latest print-on-demand technology to again make available previously out-of-print books from the distinguished backlist of Princeton University Press.

Feld, <i>Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists</i></b><br><br>"Anybody with some interest in the way scientists live, feel and think, should read this book. They will be richly rewarded and entertained."<b>---Victor Weisskopf, <i>London Times Higher Education Supplement</i></b>The lighthearted title is a clue to the easy-going style of Peierls's memoir of a career spent working (and sometimes playing) with his peersthe scientists whose ideas and experiments generated the awesome body of laws and theories known as quantum physics. Born in Germany in 1907, Peierls lived to win a British knighthoodbut never, it seems, once he had escaped Hitler's Germany with his Russian-born wife, settled in one place long enough to feel more than a bird-of-passage. Out of Peierls's recollections of life in universities and labs, he constructs a lively, charming and informative behind-the-scenes account of men and women on the forefront of physics. Peierls studied or worked on several continents, numbered Bethe, Bohr, Rutherford and other greats among his friends, andhere revealingly describedcontributed to the development of the A-bomb at Los Alamos right up its first use, at Hiroshima.

Many claims have been made about its secrets but the true mystery is the most unlikely claim of all-the existence of a group of families descended from the twenty-four high priests of the Temple in Jerusalem. </p><p>The Rex Deus story is the first full examination of this shadowy dynasty who have repeatedly conspired together to alter the course of history, and the key role it played in the succession of the House of David to the throne of Jerusalem after the first Crusade.

Rappaport lives and writes in upstate New York.<br><br>Bryan Collier received a Caldecott Honor and a Coretta Scott King Honor for <i>Martin&#x2019;s Big Words,</i> by Doreen Rappaport. He was also awarded a Coretta Scott King Honor for their first collaboration, <i>Freedom River,</i> as well as the Coretta Scott King Medal for his own work, <i>Uptown.</i>Gr. 3-5. Based on a true slave escape story, this picture book for older children combines an exciting, heartrending narrative with dramatic collage and watercolor pictures. John Parker was an ex-slave who became a successful businessman and an active conductor on the Underground Railroad. On one of his journeys, he helped an African American couple escape with their baby from the slave state of Kentucky to the free state of Ohio. The white owner knew the slave parents would never leave their child behind, so he had the baby sleep at the foot of his bed; but Parker stole the baby, tricked the master, and led the family across the river to freedom. Rappaport frames the incident with a biography of Parker, who may have helped as many as 900 African Americans. In a note, illustrator Bryan Collier speaks about his pictures, but his main commentary is about his own religion: he believes that Parker's story is about the power of prayer. His spiritual message will appeal to some readers; others will find it intrusive and simply focus on the inspiring story and stirring narrative pictures. <i>Hazel Rochman</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

She taught at Northwest Missouri State University and at George Mason University. She has had stories in the <i>Ring of Fire</i> anthology and <i>Grantville Gazette</i> (#1), and more stories in the online <i>Grantville Gazette</i>s. She has three grown children and five grandchildren, and lives in Arlington, VA, with her husband.The intricacies of Habsburg family relations make surprisingly fascinating reading in the latest episode in Flint's saga of a 20th-century West Virginia town transported mysteriously to 17th-century Europe. The recently widowed Duke Maximilian of Bavaria reluctantly assents to a dynastic marriage with his niece, Archduchess Maria Anna of Austria, but her recent reading of an uptime encyclopedia and the American Constitution leads her to consider other, previously unimaginable options. Meanwhile, Don Fernando, the Spanish Cardinal-Infante, moves toward peace with the fledgling United States of Europe while laying siege to Amsterdam and searching for a suitable bride. Flint teams up once again with historian DeMarce (<i>1634: The Ram Rebellion</i>) to tell a complicated but coherent story. It is especially refreshing to read an alternate history that doesn't depend upon the clash of anachronistic arms, but rather on how modern ideas of human rights, education, sanitation and law might have affected the Europe of the 30 Years War. <i>(Oct.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Good, A very good, clean &amp; sound copy.</p><p>Nicholas Ostler is a scholar and scientist of languages, who has a working knowledge of 26 languages and who set up five years ago the Foundation for Endangered Languages, an international organisation, to provide funding and support to document and revitilise languages in peril. With his own company Linguacubun Ltd., he regularly advises governments and corporations on policy in the field of computers and natural language processing.*Starred Review* Caesar led his legions into battle for the glory of Rome--and the immortality of Greek. In the curious spread of Greek through Roman conquest, Ostler recounts one of the many fascinating episodes in the complex history of languages. The resources of the cultural historian complement those of the comparative linguist in this capacious work, which sets the parameters for a new field of scholarship: "language dynamics." By peering over Ostler's shoulder into this new field, readers learn how languages ancient and modern (Sumerian and Egyptian; Spanish and English) spread and how they dwindle. The raw force of armies counts, of course, in determining language fortunes but for far less than the historically naive might suppose: military might failed to translate into lasting linguistic conquest for the Mongols, Turks, or Russians. Surprisingly, trade likewise proves weak in spreading a language--as the Phoenician and Dutch experiences both show. In contrast, immigration and fertility powerfully affect the fate of languages, as illustrated by the parallel histories of Egyptian and Chinese. Ostler explores the ways modern technologies of travel and communication shape language fortunes, but he also highlights the power of ancient faiths--Christian and Moslem, Buddhist and Hindu--to anchor language traditions against rapid change. Of particular interest will be Ostler's provocative conjectures about a future in which Mandarin or Arabic take the lead or in which English fractures into several tongues. Few books bring more intellectual excitement to the study of language. <i>Bryce Christensen</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

The reader will also learn about key experiments, generally ignored by the West, that led the Soviets to discover and exploit these mechanisms, including: Kaznacheyev&#39;s cytopathogenic effect Devyatkov&#39;s information content of the field The meaning of the microwave radiation of the U.S. embassy in Moscow. Also included are Whittaker&#39;s 1903 and 1904 papers, often cited in other Bearden works, whose mathematics (unrecognized at the time) underpins the structured scalar potential. In a final appendix Bearden proposes a solution to the &#34;holy grail&#34; of physics - the unification of electromagnetics, general relativity and quantum mechanics - via the Whittaker model.</p><p></p><h2>The Nellie J. Banks: The Life History of a Nova Scotian Schooner with a Newfoundland Crew That Helped Prince Edward Islands Cope with Prohibition</h2><p>As we move towards the end of the twentieth century in these days of freely available alcohol it is hard to believe that only a few decades have elapsed since Prohibition was in force to varying degrees all over Canada and the United States. The illegal importation of liquor into the Maritime Provinces and New England States gave employment to unemployed. They used fishing schooners no longer profitably engaged at their original trade. Of these the Nellie J.

What these collections say about the collectors, and about human beings in general, is the subject of this strangely beautiful and rich compendium. Here are Purcell's wonderfully exotic photographs of teeth and other human artifacts from the collection of Peter the Great; moles, pigs, and dogs from van Heurn's many boxes of perfectly preserved skins; and all manner of preserved life from Rothschild's Birds of Paradise to the fish of Agassiz. Here also is Gould at his best, delighting in the unusual and making connections to our own history and evolution that only the most fertile and whimsical mind could imagine - and that few will be able to resist. This is a book for those with a craving for beauty, knowledge, and a fascination with the unusual.</p><p>Stephen Jay Gould (1941-2002) was the Alexander Agassiz Professor of Zoology and Professor of Geology at Harvard University.

On the first day of school, high-school principal Tom Gardner thinks his biggest problem is finding the shipment of textbooks for his wife Claire's English class; but the most difficult ordeal of his life is about to begin. Tom's real troubles start when he meets a new student, Kent Arens, who turns out to be smart, well-mannered, a star athlete-and the illegitimate son Tom never knew he had, conceived during a one-night stand 18 years ago, just before Tom married Claire. Tom swings between fear that Claire will find out about Kent and pride in his newfound son, but when the boy, unaware of his lineage, starts courting Tom's 16-year-old daughter, Chelsea, Tom is forced to reveal his secret. Claire, bitter and angry, asks Tom to move out of their home. Robby, their son, resents his new brother and takes out his anger on Kent on the football field. Chelsea, meanwhile, starts running with the wrong crowd. But while Tom and Claire grow farther apart, the three siblings decide to become friends. Together, they reunite Tom and Claire, restoring family harmony. While the course of events is predictable, the characters are warmly drawn and their dilemmas realistic, and Spencer knows how to tug at readers' hearstrings. Chalk up another likely bestseller, the 11th in 11 years for this consistently commercial author.

Gabbin</p><p>The Furious Flower Conference of 1994 represented the largest gathering of African American writers at one event in nearly thirty years. In that crucial span of time, African American poetry had evolved into an art less overtly political and more introspective; it had also shown dramatic growth&#x2015;both in the number of its readers and its practitioners.</p><p> As a second Furious Flower Conference prepares to convene, Joanne Gabbin has assembled a remarkable selection of works by the Furious Flower participants. The forty-three poets cover three generations, ranging from such established voices as Michael Harper, Nikki Giovanni, and the late Gwendolyn Brooks, in whose honor the conference was organized, to a host of rising young writers who are reimagining America in the language of a hip-hop nation. </p><p>Furious Flower provides a fascinating collective portrait of African American poetry at the close of the twentieth century&#x2015;as well as an indication of where it may be headed as we enter the twenty-first. The book includes biographies of the contributors and a dynamic collection of performance photographs by C. B. Claiborne featuring many of the Furious Flower participants as they appeared at the original 1994 conference.</p><p>Contributors</p><p>Gwendolyn Brooks * Samuel Allen * Adam David Miller * Pinkie Gordon Lane * Naomi Long Madgett * Dolores Kendrick * Garrett McDowell * Raymond R.

He built his own log cabin, hunted and fished, worked with the native Inuit, and became one of the world's top sled-dog racers. But he also watched the land he loved being destroyed by the tools of the very society he represented. Disgusted and distraught, Brunk left Alaska and hitchhiked across Africa, Asia, and North America, where he witnessed continuing destruction from the hands of humans. He returned to Alaska, committed to fight to save what is left of the wilderness. This personal story explores the deeply American contradictions that make up modern Alaska and questions our cultural inability to both love and protect the land.<br></p><p><strong>R. Glendon Brunk spent 30 years living and working in Alaska and is dedicated to protecting the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. He teaches at Prescott College. He lives in Phoenix, Arizona.<br></strong>This engaging memoir by a professor of creative writing and environmental studies at Prescott College tells the story of a young man growing up and a land becoming tamed. Brunk, who drove west the moment his high school graduation ceremony ended, eventually arrives in the wilds of Alaska in 1968. Newly married and ready to be a "real" man, he lives his "Jack London notion of life": hunting, fishing, building his own log cabin and beginning to race sled dogs. Over the next 12 years, Brunk becomes one of the world's top sled dog racers; he experiences fatherhood and later divorce. But after winning the world championship of sled dog racing in 1980, Brunk sells his dog team and leaves Alaska's shrinking wilderness behind, heeding a voice that "kept prodding, kept insisting that something else needed doing." The nomadic Brunk then embarks on a seven-year odyssey around Africa, South America and Asia. He thrives on the "open, reckless engagement with the world," spends his 40th birthday camped out in the Serengeti, "in love with life, with the myriad possibilities of it all," and eventually comes to embrace simplicity and challenge Western notions of success. Finally, largely in response to a plea from his daughter, Brunk decides to return to North America and "life without bears," and to commit himself to protecting the Alaskan wilderness he loves. Although occasionally unpolished, at its best Brunk's prose is direct and heartfelt. This is a stirring memoir from one man who heard the call of the wild and answered it. <p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Think Like a Billionaire, Become a Billionaire</h2><p>Billionaires Think Differently About: <p>Money we look for ways to spend money.

In just one year, Scot changed his thinking, and this took him from having a net worth of maybe $250,000 on a good day, to a net worth of over $3,000,000 in just one year. That&#x2019;s a net worth more than twelve times where he started, with an additional $15,000,000 in current projects. If he continue on that pace, he should be a billionaire in the next ten years.

A New York newspaper writer transplanted to a hog farm on the "baking brown plains" sees a sagging trailer, rubbish, and waist-high weeds where her exuberant husband sees only promise. Waking on a bed of sweet straw after sobbing hysterically, she finds "dozens of piglets curled around me, nestled against my hips, tucked under my outspread arms, piled like a halo around my head." Other contributors wax poetic, describing an old pickup truck that "wanders down the road like a drunken goose" or steam coming off a newborn lamb in the chill night air. The selections tend toward rough-edged and gritty, but all are heartfelt.NANCY CURTIS owns and operates High Plains Press from her cattle ranch, publishing award-winning books of poetry and nonfiction.</p><h2>The Gentle Art of Verbal Self Defense</h2><p>Don&#39;t turn the other cheek and fume quietly; know what to say when someone throws out the snide backhanded &#34;compliment,&#34; subtle insult, cruel criticism, or outright verbal blow.

The birth dates were different, but the date of death was the same: <i>August 28, 1998.<br><br></i>A lump formed in Hannah&#x2019;s throat, and she swallowed hard as she knelt down, sitting back on her heels.

She squeezed her eyes shut, searching for the strength to move ahead. She and Matt had worked out the plans for more than a year. It was the right thing, she was sure of that much. Even now, with sadness covering her heart like a blanket, she could feel the excitement welling within her, convincing her that somehow, sometime soon, it would happen.<br><br>She would be a mother again.<br><br>&#x201c;Hi...&#x201d; She set her fingertips on Alicia&#x2019;s tombstone and dusted off a layer of dirt. &#x201c;I have something to tell you.&#x201d;<br><br>A crow sounded in the distance. This visit was for peace of mind and nothing more. Hannah&#x2019;s precious oldest daughter would never have questioned her intentions, never have doubted her place in Hannah&#x2019;s heart. Her fingers stopped moving and settled over Alicia&#x2019;s name.<br><br>&#x201c;Matt and I have decided to...to adopt a little girl.&#x201d; Her voice broke, and from behind her sunglasses tears trickled down her face and dripped off her chin.<br><br>She waited until she could find her voice. &#x201c;After...after the accident I couldn&#x2019;t imagine ever loving another man,&#x201d; Hannah wiped the back of her hand across her wet chin. &#x201c;Or another daughter.&#x201d; A sound that was part laugh, part sob slipped from her lips. &#x201c;But here I am, happy, married, and...convinced God has another daughter for me somewhere out there.&#x201d;<br><br>The traffic hummed from the road behind her. &#x201c;You understand, right, Alicia? I&#x2019;m not trying to...to replace you, honey.&#x201d; She sniffed. &#x201c;The bond you and I shared, the one you and Jenny shared, that&#x2019;s something none of us will ever have again. Not like it was.&#x201d;<br><br>Hannah paused and gazed up, willing herself to see beyond the blue to the place where Tom and Alicia now lived and loved and laughed.<br><br>Gradually her eyes shifted back to the tombstones. &#x201c;I saw a documentary last night about kids in America, kids waiting for someone to love them, and...I don&#x2019;t know... something inside me snapped.&#x201d; She shrugged and managed a smile despite the fresh tears on her cheeks. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t have more babies. We&#x2019;ve known that since Jenny was born. But adoption?&#x201d; She sniffed. &#x201c;I wasn&#x2019;t sure I could do it...until last night. Then, all of a sudden, I knew.

But I know she&#x2019;s out there somewhere.

The image of her oldest daughter grew clear in her mind once more. &#x201c;Alicia...&#x201d;<br><br>There she was. The smile, the honey blonde hair, the warmth in her eyes...it was all as close and real as if she were standing there in person.<br><br>There were no words, but a distinct sense of approval pierced the darkness. The feeling swelled, and Hannah had no doubts. God wanted her to know Alicia would have supported this decision with her whole being.<br><br>Hannah ached to reach out and pull the image of her daughter close, but the lines began to blur. As they did, peace oozed between the cracks in Hannah&#x2019;s heart. It was okay to let her daughter&#x2019;s memory fade for now. The visit had reminded her once more that she no longer needed to feel the pain of Alicia&#x2019;s and Tom&#x2019;s deaths with every excruciating breath, but only as a sad truth that simply was and could not be changed.<br><br>Hope wrapped its arms around her as she opened her eyes. It was time to go home, time to let Matt and Jenny know what she&#x2019;d decided. Of course, Jade and Tanner Eastman would want to know, too. The couple had become their best friends these past years. They&#x2019;d been there while Matt and Hannah walked through a year of collecting documents and filling out adoption forms, gathering letters and completing a dossier.<br><br>The Eastmans understood. They were desperate to have a baby, but so far hadn&#x2019;t been able.<br><br>Despite Hannah&#x2019;s tears, a smile tugged at her lips. Yes, Jade and Tanner would be thrilled that Hannah was finally ready to move forward.<br><br>She let her eyes settle on Tom&#x2019;s tombstone. &#x201c;Pray for us, Tom.&#x201d; Two tears landed near his name, and she wiped her cheeks with her fingertips. &#x201c;Pray for the little girl...whoever she is.&#x201d;<br><br>Once more she looked back at the stone, at Alicia&#x2019;s name carved in it. &#x201c;One more thing, honey.

Set in 1944 at Fort Neal, a segregated army camp in Louisiana, Charles Fuller's forceful drama--which won the Pulitzer Prize in 1982 and has been regularly seen in both its original stage and its later screen version--tracks the investigation of this murder. <i>A Soldier's Play</i> is more than a detective story: it is a tough, incisive exploration of racial tensions and ambiguities among blacks and between blacks and whites that gives no easy answers and assigns no simple blame.<br></p><p><b>Charles Fuller</b>, the author of many award-winning dramas for stage and screen, teaches Afro-American studies at Temple University. He won the Pulitzer Prize for <i>A Soldier's Play</i>, as well as an Academy Award nomination for his screen adaptation, <i>A Soldier's Story</i>, starring Denzel Washington.<br>"A powerful drama...skillfully wrought...one of the most evenhanded, penetrating studies that we have yet seen."--Edwin Wilson, <i>The Wall Street Journal</i><br><br>"A relentless investigation into the complex, sometimes cryptic pathology of hate...A mature and accomplished work--from its inspired opening up of conventional theatrical form to its skillful portraiture of a dozen characters to its remarkable breadth of social and historical vision...Mr. Fuller's play tirelessly insists on embracing volatile contradictions because that is the way to arrive at the shattering truth."--Frank Rich, <i>The New York Times</i><br><br>"A complex and rewarding play [by] a playwright of great sensibility."--Clive Barnes, <i>New York Post</i><br><br>"A work of great resonance and integrity..."--Jack Kroll, <i>Newsweek</i><br></p><h2>Seven Days Battles 1862 (Campaign 133)</h2><p>Osprey&#39;s examination of the short yet crucial campaign of the American Civil War (1861-1865). When General Robert E. Lee took command of the Army of Northern Virginia, the Confederacy was in crisis. Lee changed all that in a brilliant, week-long campaign. On 26 June the Confederates struck, fighting two hard-fought battles in two days at Mechanicsville and Gaine&#39;s Mill. The ferocity of the Confederate assaults convinced McClellan that he was outnumbered. Unable to keep the Confederates at bay, the Union army was recalled to Washington. Despite losing a quarter of his men, Lee had saved Richmond, and inflicted a humiliating defeat on the Army of the Potomac.</p><p>Highly visual guides to history&#39;s greatest conflicts, detailing the command strategies, tactics, and experiences of the opposing forces throughout each campaign, and concluding with a guide to the battlefields today.Angus Konstam hails from the Orkney Islands and is the author of over 15 books, many of which are published by Osprey.

Born in 1967 to the son of Wyoming ranchers and a daughter of the Turtle Clan of the Seneca Nation (Haudenosaunee), she identifies herself as "half cowboy and half Indian." Formally, her work draws from Indigenous design principles, oral tradition, personal experience, and western art history. Her approach to art-making is shaped by the proto-feminism of Haudenosaunee matrilineal custom, political work by Native artists in the '60s, a discourse on multiculturalism, Abstract Expressionism, and Pop Art, as well as a strong belief in interaction with her audience. Like Jasper Johns, she is interested in "things that the mind already knows." Unlike the Pop artists, she uses a vocabulary of natural materials (stone, corn husks, wool, cedar) and forms (blankets, pillows, bridges) that are universal to human experience and noncommercial in character. <i>Marie Watt: Lodge</i> offers the first comprehensive view of her work, covering a period extending from the mid-1990s to the present.</p><p><b>Rebecca J.

Hot, humid rain. Rain that tasted metallic and fell, like blades, pricking skin.</i> <br> <br>Marie was dry, parched. Awake inside her dream.<br> <br>For weeks, she&#x2019;d been having the same dream; she&#x2019;d been trying to interpret it, break the horrific spell.<br> <br><i>&#x201c;Water, water, everywhere, and not a drop to drink.&#x201d;</i> The phrase kept rewinding in her mind.

Her legs were tangled in the sheets; sweat blanketed her skin.<br> <br> <i>She dove back down into her dream, through layers of thought, anxiety, and consciousness.</i> <br> <br>Inhale, exhale. Breathe.<br> <br> <i>The river was widening, swallowing, then spitting up more bodies.</i> <br> <br> <i>The Gu�d�, the death gods, in top hat and tails, were standing on a bridge, pointing at the dead.

They didn&#x2019;t make sound, rather, Marie</i> felt <i>their howling&#x2014;an obscene absence of sound that terrorized, rattling her bones.</i><br> <br> <i>Both inside and outside her dream, Marie wanted to run, hide, burrow into a hole so deep, no one&#x2014;tangible or intangible&#x2014;could ever touch her.</i> <br> <br>Each night, this was when and where her dream ended&#x2014;the Gu�d� howling, refusing to look deeper into the water.<br> <br>If the Gu�d� were afraid to look, why should she?<br> <br>Her body constricted; her respiration quickened; her legs grew rigid, tight. She rasped, &#x201c;Let me see. I am Marie. I need to see.&#x201d;<br> <br><i>She fell, hard, fast.</i> Screaming, she clawed at the sheets. <i>Her body jerked; the freefall stopped.</i><br> <br> <i>Parallel, weightless, she floated inches above the river water.</i> <br> <br> <i>She recoiled.</i> <br> <br> <i>Bodies bobbed so close she could touch them: a woman, her lips locked in a grimace, her arms flung over her head; a blue baby, covered in algae like a desolate infant Moses; and a man, twisted onto his side, insects burrowing into his exposed cheek and nostril.</i> <br> <br> <i>Snakes greased through brown water. A baby crocodile perched on a dead body like a log.</i> <br> <br> <i>She smelled waste&#x2014;human and inhuman.

Marie-Claire, I&#x2019;m coming. Mama&#x2019;s coming.&#x201d;<br> <br>The blue revolving lamp had stopped, its silhouettes of birds were dim and static on the ceiling and bedroom walls. The night-light, in the wall outlet, flickered, its power waning.<br> <br>Marie-Claire lay facedown on the pillow.<br> <br>&#x201c;Baby.&#x201d; Fearfully, gently, she turned Marie-Claire over.<br> <br>Marie-Claire was asleep; her lids closed tight, her eyelashes fanning long, delicately. She was hot, her face flushed, her brown curls matted on her brow and neck. But no fever.<br> <br>She was asleep.<br> <br>Wind lifted the bedroom curtains like birds&#x2019; wings. Marie trembled with relief.<br> <br> <i>&#x201c;Women hand sight down through the generations.

Maybe she was still dreaming?<br> <br>Marie prayed her daughter&#x2019;s dreams were sweet. No bloated bodies. Only rainbows, magnolias, and friends at play.<br> <br>&#x201c;Marie-Claire,&#x201d; she whispered, gently shaking her.<br> <br>Marie-Claire&#x2019;s eyes fluttered, her breath smelled like almonds.<br> <br>&#x201c;Mama, go bye?

Bye-bye.&#x201d; Still slumbering, Marie-Claire turned, onto her side, her tiny fists curled beneath her chin.<br> <br>Marie kissed the tip of her nose, then quickly turned, sensing a presence.<br> <br> <i>Baron Samedi, the Gu�d� leader, was solemn, all skeleton and shadow.</i> <br> <br> <i>Cocking his head, he pointed a gloved finger at the night-light. It glowed, strong and bright, like a lighthouse guiding lost sailors home. He touched the lamp. The birds continued their kaleidoscopic flight across the ceiling and walls. Then, Samedi waved his hand.</i> <br> <br>&#x201c;South. Birds flying south,&#x201d; she whispered.<br> <br>In the Sleeping Beauties case, she&#x2019;d learned the Gu�d� despised those who interfered with death. She learned, too, that if the Gu�d� refused to dig your grave, you wouldn&#x2019;t die.<br> <br>Asleep and awake, the Gu�d� were guiding her.<br> <br>&#x201c;You coming?&#x201d; she asked the baron softly.<br> <br> <i>Baron Samedi tipped his hat and shook his head. He sat on the bed, then leaned forward, his gloved fingers stroking Marie-Claire&#x2019;s hair.</i> <br> <br>The hair on her skin rose. From her medical training, she knew it was a chemical reaction spurred by fear, the fight or flight response. Adrenaline was raising her blood pressure, making her heart beat faster.<br> <br>It was startling to see Death touching Marie-Claire.<br> <br> <i>Baron Samedi smiled, a grimace of a skeletal jaw, lost and rotten teeth.</i> <br> <br>&#x201c;You won&#x2019;t hurt her.&#x201d; It was a statement, not a question. The Gu�d� were encouraging her to follow her dream to its source.<br> <br>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t do oatmeal, do you?&#x201d;<br> <br> <i>Samedi sat, cross-legged, at the foot of the bed.</i> <br> <br>Marie smiled. What better babysitter than Death itself?<br> <br>She suddenly wanted to wake Marie-Claire. To see her smile and see herself reflected in her daughter&#x2019;s eyes. She bent, pressing her lips against Marie-Claire&#x2019;s cheek, inhaling her sweet scent.<br> <br>&#x201c;Thank you, Baron. I&#x2019;m grateful.&#x201d;<br> <br> <i>Samedi kept mute.</i> <br> <br>Marie walked quickly out of the room. She needed to call the hospital, rearrange her shifts. She needed to call the sitter, Louise. She&#x2019;d take care of Marie-Claire&#x2019;s temporal needs: fix her food, keep her warm, and read her a story. Without question, Marie-Claire would be safe. Baron Samedi himself would refuse to ferry her to the afterlife, the other world.<br> <br>Marie let her drawstring pajama pants fall to the floor. She slipped on underwear, jeans, and buttoned a black shirt over her cotton tee. She pitched extra panties, shirts, a comb, and a toothbrush into an overnight bag.<br> <br>What did it mean? Any of it?<br> <br>The Gu�d� were telling her that the bodies in the river were only part of a mystery she needed to solve&#x2014;there was still more to discover, more to dream.<br> <br>She&#x2019;d drive south. And pray she&#x2019;d stay alive, her spirit whole.<br> <br>She saw herself reflected in the mirror: thick brown hair pulled back in a ponytail; lean rather than voluptuous; bags beneath her eyes from working too hard as a mother, a doctor.<br> <br>If the Gu�d� were here, her daughter was at risk. The balance between life and death was unsettled, unraveling.<br> <br>Her life&#x2019;s calling was to heal&#x2014;and her dream, even though it didn&#x2019;t make any sense, was, somehow, a call for her skills.<br> <br>She snapped her overnight bag shut.<br> <br> <i>The river&#x2019;s mouth, the river&#x2019;s mouth.</i> <br> <br>There was only one place in Louisiana to go&#x2014;the Gulf of Mexico.

He lay still. The water lapped gently against the bulbous nose of his mechanical whale, as he waited for an answer.<br> &nbsp;<br> One more time he checked the tiny indicators on his helmet display. Yes, the radio was working. The occupant of the other waldo whale, lying half submerged a few meters away, had heard every word.<br> &nbsp;<br> The water was exceptionally clear today. Facing downward, he could see a small leopard shark swim lazily past, a bit out of place here in the deeper water offshore.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Makakai...are you ready?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> He tried not to sound impatient, or betray the tension he felt building in the back of his neck as he waited. He closed his eyes and made the delinquent muscles relax, one by one. Still, he waited for his pupil to speak.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Yesss...let&#x2019;sss do it!&#x201d; came the warbling, squeaky voice, at last. The words sounded breathless, as if spoken grudgingly, in lieu of inhalation.<br> &nbsp;<br> A nice long speech for Makakai. He could see the young dolphin&#x2019;s training machine next to his, its image reflected in the mirrors that rimmed his faceplate. Its gray metal flukes lifted and fell slightly with the swell. Feebly, without their power, her artificial fins moved, sluggishly under the transient, serrated surface of the water.<br> &nbsp;<br> She&#x2019;s as ready as she&#x2019;ll ever be, he thought. If technology can wean a dolphin of the Whale-Dream, now&#x2019;s the time we&#x2019;ll find out.<br> &nbsp;<br> He chinned the microphone switch again. &#x201c;All right, Makakai. You know how the waldo works. It will amplify any action you make, but if you want the rockets to cut in, you&#x2019;ll have to give the command in English. Just to be fair, I have to whistle in trinary to make mine work.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Yesss!&#x201d; she hissed. Her waldo&#x2019;s gray flukes thrashed up once and down with a boom and a spray of saltwater.<br> &nbsp;<br> With a half muttered prayer to the Dreamer, he touched a switch releasing the amplifiers on both Makakai&#x2019;s waldo and his own, then cautiously turned his arms to set the fins into motion. He flexed his legs, the massive flukes thrust back jerkily in response, and his machine immediately rolled over and sank.<br> &nbsp;<br> Jacob tried to correct but overcompensated, making the waldo tumble even worse. The beating of his fins momentarily made the area around him a churning mass of bubbles, until patiently, by trial and error, he got himself righted.<br> &nbsp;<br> He pushed off again, carefully, to get some headway, then arched his back and kicked out. The waldo responded with a great tail-slashing leap into the air.<br> &nbsp;<br> The dolphin was almost a kilometer off. As he reached the top of his arc, Jacob saw her fall gracefully from a height of ten meters to slice smoothly into the swell below.<br> &nbsp;<br> He pointed his helmet beak at the water and the sea came at him like a green wall. The impact made his helmet ring as he tore through tendrils of floating kelp, sending a golden Garibaldi darting away in panic as he drove downwards.<br> &nbsp;<br> He was going in too steep. He swore and kicked twice to straighten out. The machine&#x2019;s massive metal flukes beat at the water to the rhythmic push of his feet, each beat sending a tremor up his spine, pressing him against the suit&#x2019;s heavy padding. When the time was right, he arched and kicked again. The machine ripped out of the water.<br> &nbsp;<br> Sunlight flashed like a missile in his left window, its glare drowning the dim glow of his tiny instrument panel. The helmet computer chuckled softly as he twisted, beak down, to crash into the bright water once again.<br> &nbsp;<br> As a school of tiny silver anchovies scattered before him, Jacob hooted out loud with exhilaration.<br> &nbsp;<br> His hands slipped along the controls to the rocket verniers, and at the top of his next arc he whistled a code in trinary. Motors hummed, as the exoskeleton extended winglets along its sides. Then the boosters cut in with a savage burst, pressing the padded headpiece upward with the sudden acceleration, pinching the back of his skull as the waves swept past, just below his hurtling craft.<br> &nbsp;<br> He came down near Makakai with a great splash. She whistled a shrill trinary welcome. Jacob let the rockets shut off automatically and resumed the purely mechanical leaping beside her.<br> &nbsp;<br> For a time they moved in unison. With each leap Makakai grew more daring, performing twists and pirouettes during the long seconds before they struck the water. Once, in midair, she rattled off a dirty limerick in dolphin, a low piece of work, but Jacob hoped they&#x2019;d recorded it back at the chase boat. He&#x2019;d missed the punch line at the crashing end of the aerial cycle.<br> &nbsp;<br> The rest of the training team followed behind them on the hovercraft. During each leap he caught sight of the large vessel, diminished, now, by distance, until his impact cut off everything but the sounds of splitting water, Makakai&#x2019;s sonar squeaking, and the rushing, phosphorescent blue-green past his windows.<br> &nbsp;<br> Jacob&#x2019;s chronometer indicated that ten minutes had passed. He wouldn&#x2019;t be able to keep up with Makakai for more than a half hour, no matter how much amplification he used. A man&#x2019;s muscles and nervous system weren&#x2019;t designed for this leap-and-crash routine.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Makakai, it&#x2019;s time to try the rockets. Let me know if you&#x2019;re ready and we&#x2019;ll use them on the following jump.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> They both came down into the sea and he worked his flukes in the frothy water to prepare for the next leap. They jumped again.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Makakai, I&#x2019;m serious now. Are you ready?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> They sailed high together. He could see her tiny eye behind a plastic window as her waldo-machine twisted before slicing into the water. He followed an instant later.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Okay, Makakai. If you don&#x2019;t answer me, we&#x2019;ll just have to stop right now.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Blue water swept past, along with a cloud of bubbles, as he pushed along beside his pupil.<br> &nbsp;<br> Makakai twisted around and dove down instead of rising for another leap. She chattered something almost too fast to follow in trinary...about how he shouldn&#x2019;t be a spoilsport.<br> &nbsp;<br> Jacob let his machine rise slowly to the surface. &#x201c;Come dear, use the King&#x2019;s English. You&#x2019;ll need it if you ever want your children to go into space. And it&#x2019;s so expressive! Come on. Tell Jacob what you think of him.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> There were a few seconds of silence. Then he saw something move very fast below him. It streaked upward and, just before it hit the surface, he heard Makakai&#x2019;s voice shrilly taunt:<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Ch-chase me, ch-chump! I fly-y-y!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> With the last word, her mechanical flukes snapped back and she leaped out of the water on a column of flame.<br> &nbsp;<br> Laughing, he dove to give himself headway and then launched into the air after his pupil.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>The Nightingale Won&#39;t Let You Sleep</h2><p><b>From internationally acclaimed and Governor General&#x2019;s Award-winning author Steven Heighton comes a passionate novel of buried secrets, the repercussions of war and finding love among the ruins</b><br>Elias Trifannis is desperate to belong somewhere.

[He has] inherited a post-Conrad tradition, which extends from E.M. Forster to Graham Greene to John Le Carr� . . . literary practitioners and epic storytellers. <i>The Nightingale Won&#x2019;t Let You Sleep </i>is a novel about big, global forces and small, intimate moments.

Heighton is as attuned to the micro-politics of the village as to the macro-politics of Europe and the Middle East . . . His focus is sometimes hermetic, sometimes global, and he balances violent passages with lyrical descriptions of intimacy . . . The novel is full of beautiful asides. It&#x2019;s also full of memorable characters whose friendships are fraught and rich . . .

As a counter to that darkness, though, there is a faltering sense of light, a glimmer, not quite of hope, but of humanity, home and love, family and community. The combination makes for an unsettling, affecting read...The specificity and physicality of the language is evocative and, in context, electrifying...In the ruins of modern civilization, in the aftermath of atrocities and within the continuing conflict over arbitrary borders and clashes of cultures, Heighton has created a novel about the meaning of home, the search for belonging, and the ongoing creation &#x2014; and understanding &#x2014; of the self. The novel serves as a stirring reminder that the fences we build can serve as both barriers and prisons, and may, at any time, be torn away.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>The Toronto Star<br><br></i>"His stories ruminate on the question of whether, and how, we can commit to practising brotherhood within our multicultural nation and in the conflict zones of the wider world. Such exquisite, powerful meditations on who we are place Heighton among the great Canadian writers...For all Heighton&#x2019;s obsession with foreign borders and personal boundaries, it is Canada that seems to be his central concern: the fact that we are not a nation united by mother tongue or customs or race, but strenuously&#x2014;vociferously&#x2014;multicultural, individuals with roots in hundreds of nations with hundreds of borders. Is it really possible to be our multiple selves&#x2014;true, strong and free&#x2014;and, at the same time one, united country? This is a question frequently posed by Canadian writers of colour, and one Heighton ponders most elegantly as well." - <i>Literary Review of Canada</i><br><br>&#x201c;In scintillating prose and with masterly control of his plot and characters, poet and novelist Heighton (<i>Afterlands</i>) weaves a spellbinding tale of love, loyalty, and betrayal . . . highly recommended to all readers.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>Library Journal </i>(starred review)<br><br>&#x201c;This book won&#x2019;t let the reader sleep... a rich and disturbing literary thriller.&#x201d; &#x2014;Annie Proulx, author of <i>Barkskins</i><br> &nbsp;<br> "Steven Heighton writes with a beauty and a precision and a soul that's always astounded me. He captures the shock and trauma of war in a way that only a novelist at the height of his powers can.

The genius is John Rothstein, an iconic author who created a famous character, Jimmy Gold, but who hasn&#x2019;t published a book for decades. Morris Bellamy is livid, not just because Rothstein has stopped providing books, but because the nonconformist Jimmy Gold has sold out for a career in advertising.

Of course you can read <em>Finders Keepers</em> on its own if you&#x2019;re so-inclined&#x2014;King takes time to introduce new characters and new crimes in the first half of the book before carting out some familiar faces from the past. The story begins with a murder (of an author) and a robbery (of the author&#x2019;s notebooks, including at least one unpublished manuscript). The crimes will linger in your mind, but what might linger most is when King explores his obsessions with, well, obsessions: obsession with reading, obsession with writers, even the need to get revenge. The book is well-plotted, but there remains an organic feel to this series, like the characters are writing themselves to some extent. As a character in <em>Finders Keepers</em> puts it, &#x201c;a good novelist does not create events, he watches them happen then writes down what he sees. A good novelist realizes he is a secretary, not God.&#x201d; Amen. That's why we love you, Stephen King.<em>--Chris Schluep</em></p>Stephen King is the author of more than fifty books, all of them worldwide bestsellers.

Her long experience&#x2014;not only through her roles as mother, daughter, sister, and wife but also as advocate, legal expert, and public servant&#x2014;has strengthened her conviction that how children develop and what they need to succeed are inextricably entwined with the society in which they live and how well it sustains and supports its families and individuals. In other words, it takes a village to raise a child.<br> <br>In her new Introduction, Senator Clinton reflects on how our village has changed over the last decade&#x2014;from the impact of the Internet to new research in early child development and education. She discusses issues of increasing concern&#x2014;security, the environment, the national debt&#x2014;and looks at where we have made progress and where there is still work to be done.<br> <br><i>It Takes a Village</i> has become a classic. As relevant as ever, this anniversary edition makes it abundantly clear that the choices we make today about how we raise our children and how we support families will determine how our nation will face the challenges of this century.</p><p>The First Lady, a longtime child advocate, expresses her concerns for the children of today&#39;s world and offers her ideas for developing our society into one that values children&#39;s unique contributions.For more than twenty-five years, First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton has made children her passion and her cause. Her experience with children has strengthened her conviction that how children develop and what they need to succeed is inextricably entwined with the society in which they live and how well it sustains and supports its families and individuals. In other words, it takes a village to raise a child. <p> This book chronicles her quest-both deeply personal and, in the truest sense, public-to discover how we can make our society into the kind of village that enable children to grow into able, caring, resilient adults. It is time, Mrs. Clinton believes, to acknowledge that we have to make some changes for children's sake. Advances in technology and the global economy along with other developments in society have brought us much good, but they have also stressed the fabric of family life, leaving us and our children poorer in many ways - physically, intellectually, emotionally, spiritually. </p><p> She doesn't believe that we should, or can, turn back the clock. False nostalgia for "family values" is no solution. Nor is it useful to make an all-purpose bogeyman or savior of "government." But by looking honestly at the condition of our children, be sifting the past for clues to the structure that once bound us together, by identifying places where our "village" is flourishing, and, most important, be listening to the children themselves, we can begin to create for our children the better tomorrow they deserve.</p></p><h2>Sense Of An Ending</h2><p>BRAND NEW, Exactly same ISBN as listed, Please double check ISBN carefully before ordering.</p><p>Julian Barnes is the author of ten previous novels, three books of short stories, and three collections of journalism. In addition to the Booker Prize, his other honors include the Somerset Maugham Award, the Geoffrey Faber Memorial Prize, and the E.M. Forster Award from the American Academy of Arts and Letters. He lives in London.I remember, in no particular order: <br><br> &#x2013; a shiny inner wrist; <br><br> &#x2013; steam rising from a wet sink as a hot frying pan is laughingly tossed into it; <br><br> &#x2013; gouts of sperm circling a plughole, before being sluiced down the full length of a tall house; <br><br> &#x2013; a river rushing nonsensically upstream, its wave and wash lit by half a dozen chasing torchbeams; <br><br> &#x2013; another river, broad and grey, the direction of its flow disguised by a stiff wind exciting the surface; <br><br> &#x2013; bathwater long gone cold behind a locked door. This last isn&#x2019;t something I actually saw, but what you end up remembering isn&#x2019;t always the same as what you have witnessed. <br> &nbsp;<br> We live in time &#x2013; it holds us and moulds us &#x2013; but I&#x2019;ve never felt I understood it very well. And I&#x2019;m not referring to theories about how it bends and doubles back, or may exist elsewhere in parallel versions. No, I mean ordinary, everyday time, which clocks and watches assure us passes regularly: tick-tock, click-clock. Is there anything more plausible than a second hand? And yet it takes only the smallest pleasure or pain to teach us time&#x2019;s malleability. Some emotions speed it up, others slow it down; occasionally, it seems to go missing &#x2013; until the eventual point when it really does go missing, never to return. <br><br> * * * <br><br> I&#x2019;m not very interested in my schooldays, and don&#x2019;t feel any nostalgia for them. But school is where it all began, so I need to return briefly to a few incidents that have grown into anecdotes, to some approximate memories which time has deformed into certainty. If I can&#x2019;t be sure of the actual events any more, I can at least be true to the impressions those facts left. That&#x2019;s the best I can manage. <br><br> There were three of us, and he now made the fourth. We hadn&#x2019;t expected to add to our tight number: cliques and pairings had happened long before, and we were already beginning to imagine our escape from school into life. His name was Adrian Finn, a tall, shy boy who initially kept his eyes down and his mind to himself. For the first day or two, we took little notice of him: at our school there was no welcoming ceremony, let alone its opposite, the punitive induction. We just registered his presence and waited. <br><br>The masters were more interested in him than we were. They had to work out his intelligence and sense of discipline, calculate how well he&#x2019;d previously been taught, and if he might prove &#x2018;scholarship material&#x2019;. On the third morning of that autumn term, we had a history class with Old Joe Hunt, wryly affable in his three-piece suit, a teacher whose system of control depended on maintaining sufficient but not excessive boredom. <br><br> &#x2018;Now, you&#x2019;ll remember that I asked you to do some preliminary reading about the reign of Henry VIII.&#x2019; Colin, Alex and I squinted at one another, hoping that the ques�tion wouldn&#x2019;t be flicked, like an angler&#x2019;s fly, to land on one of our heads. &#x2018;Who might like to offer a characterisation of the age?&#x2019; He drew his own conclusion from our averted eyes. &#x2018;Well, Marshall, perhaps. How would you describe Henry VIII&#x2019;s reign?&#x201d;<br><br> Our relief was greater than our curiosity, because Marshall was a cautious know-nothing who lacked the inventiveness of true ignorance. He searched for possible hidden complexities in the question before eventually locating a response. <br><br> &#x2018;There was unrest, sir.&#x2019; <br><br>An outbreak of barely controlled smirking; Hunt himself almost smiled. <br><br>&#x2018;Would you, perhaps, care to elaborate?&#x2019; <br><br>Marshall nodded slow assent, thought a little longer, and decided it was no time for caution. &#x2018;I&#x2019;d say there was great unrest, sir.&#x2019; <br><br>&#x2018;Finn, then. Are you up in this period?&#x2019; <br><br>The new boy was sitting a row ahead and to my left. He had shown no evident reaction to Marshall&#x2019;s idiocies. <br><br>&#x2018;Not really, sir, I&#x2019;m afraid. But there is one line of thought according to which all you can truly say of any historical event &#x2013; even the outbreak of the First World War, for example &#x2013; is that &#x201c;something happened&#x201d;.&#x2019; <br><br>&#x2018;Is there, indeed? Well, that would put me out of a job, wouldn&#x2019;t it?&#x2019; After some sycophantic laughter, Old Joe Hunt pardoned our holiday idleness and filled us in on the polygamous royal butcher. <br><br>At the next break, I sought out Finn.&#x2018;I&#x2019;m Tony Webster.&#x2019; He looked at me warily. &#x2018;Great line to Hunt.&#x2019; He seemed not to know what I was referring to. &#x2018;About something happening.&#x2019; <br><br>&#x2018;Oh. Yes. I was rather disappointed he didn&#x2019;t take it up.&#x2019; <br><br>That wasn&#x2019;t what he was supposed to say. <br><br>Another detail I remember: the three of us, as a symbol of our bond, used to wear our watches with the face on the inside of the wrist. It was an affectation, of course, but perhaps something more. It made time feel like a personal, even a secret, thing.We expected Adrian to note the gesture, and follow suit; but he didn&#x2019;t. <br> &nbsp;<br> Later that day &#x2013; or perhaps another day &#x2013; we had a double English period with Phil Dixon, a young master just down from Cambridge. He liked to use contemporary texts, and would throw out sudden challenges.&#x2018;&#x201c;Birth, and Copulation, and Death&#x201d; &#x2013; that&#x2019;s what T. S. Eliot says it&#x2019;s all about. Any comments?&#x2019; He once compared a Shakespearean hero to Kirk Douglas in <i>Spartacus</i>. And I remember how, when we were discussing Ted Hughes&#x2019;s poetry, he put his head at a donnish slant and murmured,&#x2018;Of course, we&#x2019;re all wondering what will happen when he runs out of animals.&#x2019; Sometimes, he addressed us as &#x2018;Gentlemen&#x2019;. Naturally, we adored him. <br><br>That afternoon, he handed out a poem with no title, date or author&#x2019;s name, gave us ten minutes to study it, then asked for our responses. <br><br>&#x2018;Shall we start with you, Finn? Put simply, what would you say this poem is <i>about</i>?&#x2019; <br><br>Adrian looked up from his desk. &#x2018;Eros and Thanatos, sir.&#x2019; <br><br>&#x2018;Hmm. Go on.&#x2019; <br><br>&#x2018;Sex and death,&#x2019; Finn continued, as if it might not just be the thickies in the back row who didn&#x2019;t understand Greek. &#x2018;Or love and death, if you prefer.The erotic principle, in any case, coming into conflict with the death principle. And what ensues from that conflict. Sir.&#x2019; <br><br>I was probably looking more impressed than Dixon thought healthy. <br><br>&#x2018;Webster, enlighten us further.&#x2019; <br><br>&#x2018;I just thought it was a poem about a barn owl, sir.&#x2019; <br><br>This was one of the differences between the three of us and our new friend. We were essentially taking the piss, except when we were serious. He was essentially serious, except when he was taking the piss. It took us a while to work this out. <br> &nbsp;<br> Adrian allowed himself to be absorbed into our group, without acknowledging that it was something he sought. Perhaps he didn&#x2019;t. Nor did he alter his views to accord with ours. At morning prayers he could be heard joining in the responses while Alex and I merely mimed the words, and Colin preferred the satirical ploy of the pseudo-zealot&#x2019;s enthusiastic bellow.The three of us considered school sports a crypto-fascist plan for repressing our sex-drive; Adrian joined the fencing club and did the high jump. We were belligerently tone-deaf; he came to school with his clarinet. When Colin denounced the family, I mocked the political system, and Alex made philosophical objections to the perceived nature of reality, Adrian kept his counsel &#x2013; at first, anyway. He gave the impression that he believed in things. We did too &#x2013; it was just that we wanted to believe in our own things, rather than what had been decided for us. Hence what we thought of as our cleansing scepticism. <br><br> The school was in central London, and each day we travelled up to it from our separate boroughs, passing from one system of control to another. Back then, things were plainer: less money, no electronic devices, little fashion tyranny, no girlfriends. There was nothing to distract us from our human and filial duty which was to study, pass exams, use those qualifications to find a job, and then put together a way of life unthreateningly fuller than that of our parents, who would approve, while privately comparing it to their own earlier lives, which had been simpler, and therefore superior. None of this, of course, was ever stated: the genteel social Darwinism of the English middle classes always remained implicit. <br><br> &#x2018;Fucking bastards, parents,&#x2019; Colin complained one Monday lunchtime. &#x2018;You think they&#x2019;re OK when you&#x2019;re little, then you realise they&#x2019;re just like . . .&#x2019; <br><br> &#x2018;Henry VIII, Col?&#x2019; Adrian suggested.We were beginning to get used to his sense of irony; also to the fact that it might be turned against us as well.When teasing, or calling us to seriousness, he would address me as Anthony; Alex would become Alexander, and the unlengthenable Colin shortened to Col. <br><br> &#x2018;Wouldn&#x2019;t mind if my dad had half a dozen wives.&#x2019; <br><br>&#x2018;And was incredibly rich.&#x2019; <br><br>&#x2018;And painted by Holbein.&#x2019; <br><br>&#x2018;And told the Pope to sod off.&#x2019; <br><br>&#x2018;Any particular reason why they&#x2019;re FBs?&#x2019; Alex asked Colin. <br><br>&#x2018;I wanted us to go to the funfair. They said they had to spend the weekedn gardening.&#x2019; <br><br>Right: fucking bastards. Except to Adrian, who listened to our denunciations, but rarely joined in. And yet, it seemed to us, he had more cause than most. His mother had walked out years before, leaving his dad to cope with Adrian and his sister. This was long before the term &#x2018;single�parent family&#x2019; came into use; back then it was &#x2018;a broken home&#x2019;, and Adrian was the only person we knew who came from one. This ought to have given him a whole storetank of existential rage, but somehow it didn&#x2019;t; he said he loved his mother and respected his father. Privately, the three of us examined his case and came up with a theory: that the key to a happy family life was for there not to be a family &#x2013; or at least, not one living together. Having made this analysis, we envied Adrian the more. <br>&nbsp; <br><br> In those days, we imagined ourselves as being kept in some kind of holding pen, waiting to he released into our lives. And when that moment came, our lives &#x2013; and time itself &#x2013; would speed up. How were we to know that our lives had in any case begun, that some advantage had already been gained, some damage already inflicted? Also, that our release would only be into a larger holding pen, whose boundaries would be at first undiscernible. <br><br>In the meantime, we were book-hungry, sex-hungry, meritocratic, anarchistic. All political and social systems appeared to us corrupt, yet we declined to consider an alternative other than hedonistic chaos. Adrian, however, pushed us to believe in the application of thought to life, in the notion that principles should guide actions. Previously, Alex had been regarded as the philosopher among us. He had read stuff the other two hadn&#x2019;t, and might, for instance, suddenly declare, &#x2018;Whereof we cannot speak, thereof must we remain silent.&#x2019; Colin and I would consider this idea in silence for a while, then grin and carry on talking. But now Adrian&#x2019;s arrival dislodged Alex from his position &#x2013; or rather, gave us another choice of philosopher. If Alex had read Russell and Wittgenstein, Adrian had read Camus and Nietzsche. I had read George Orwell and Aldous Huxley; Colin had read Baudelaire and Dostoevsky. This is only a slight caricature. <br><br>Yes, of course we were pretentious &#x2013; what else is youth for? We used terms like &#x2018;<i>Weltanschauung</i>&#x2019; and &#x2018;<i>Sturm und Drang</i>&#x2019;, enjoyed saying &#x2018;That&#x2019;s philosophically self-evident&#x2019;, and assured one another that the imagination&#x2019;s first duty was to be transgressive. Our parents saw things differently, picturing their children as innocents suddenly exposed to noxious influence. So Colin&#x2019;s mother referred to me as his &#x2018;dark angel&#x2019;; my father blamed Alex when he found me reading <i>The Communist Manifesto</i>; Colin was fingered by Alex&#x2019;s parents when they caught him with a hard-boiled American crime novel. And so on. It was the same with sex. Our parents thought we might be corrupted by one another into becoming whatever it was they most feared: an incorrigible masturbator, a winsome homosexual, a recklessly impregnatory libertine. On our behalf they dreaded the closeness of adolescent friendship, the predatory behaviour of strangers on trains, the lure of the wrong kind of girl. How far their anxieties outran our experience. <br>&nbsp; <br><br> One afternoon Old Joe Hunt, as if picking up Adrian&#x2019;s earlier challenge, asked us to debate the origins of the First World War: specifically, the responsibility of Archduke Franz Ferdinand&#x2019;s assassin for starting the whole thing off. Back then, we were most of us absolutists. We liked Yes v No, Praise v Blame, Guilt v Innocence &#x2013; or, in Marshall&#x2019;s case, Unrest v Great Unrest. We liked a game that ended in a win and loss, not a draw. And so for some, the Serbian gunman, whose name is long gone from my memory, had one hundred per cent individual responsibility: take him out of the equation, and the war would never have happened. Others preferred the one hundred per cent responsibility of historical forces, which had placed the antagonistic nations on an inevitable collision course: &#x2018;Europe was a powder keg waiting to blow&#x2019;, and so on. The more anarchic, like Colin, argued that everything was down to chance, that the world existed in a state of perpetual chaos, and only some primitive storytelling instinct, itself doubtless a hangover from religion, retrospectively imposed meaning on what might or might not have happened. <br><br>Hunt gave a brief nod to Colin&#x2019;s attempt to undermine everything, as if morbid disbelief was a natural by-product of adolescence, something to be grown out of. Masters and parents used to remind us irritatingly that they too had once been young, and so could speak with authority. It&#x2019;s just a phase, they would insist. You&#x2019;ll grow out of it; life will teach you reality and realism. But back then we declined to acknowledge that they had ever been anything like us, and we knew that we grasped life &#x2013; and truth, and morality, and art &#x2013; far more clearly than our compromised elders. <br><br>&#x2018;Finn, you&#x2019;ve been quiet. You started this ball rolling. You are, as it were our Serbian gunman.&#x2019; Hunt paused to let the allusion take effect. &#x2018;Would you care to give us the benefit of your thoughts?&#x2019; <br><br>&#x2018;I don&#x2019;t know, sir.&#x2019; <br><br>&#x2018;What don&#x2019;t you know?&#x2019; <br><br>&#x2018;Well, in one sense. I can&#x2019;t know what it is that I don&#x2019;t know. That&#x2019;s philosophically self-evident.&#x2019; He left one of those slight pauses in which we again wondered if he was engaged in subtle mockery or a high seriousness beyond the rest of us.&#x2018;Indeed, isn&#x2019;t the whole business of ascribing responsibility a kind of cop-out? We want to blame an individual so that everyone else is exculpated. Or we blame a historical process as a way of exonerating individuals. Or it&#x2019;s all anarchic chaos, with the same consequence. It seems to me that there is &#x2013; was &#x2013; a chain of individual respon�sibilities, all of which were necessary, but not so long a chain that everybody can simply blame everyone else. But of course, my desire to ascribe responsibility might be more a reflection of my own cast of mind than a fair analysis of what happened.That&#x2019;s one of the central problems of history, isn&#x2019;t it, sir? The question of subjective versus objective interpretation, the fact that we need to know the history of the historian in order to understand the version that is being put in front of us.&#x2019; <br><br>There was a silence. And no, he wasn&#x2019;t taking the piss, not in the slightest. <br><br>Old Joe Hunt looked at his watch and smiled. &#x2018;Finn, I retire in five years. And I shall be happy to give you a reference if you care to take over.&#x2019; And he wasn&#x2019;t taking the piss either.</p><h2>Enchantment: The Life of Audrey Hepburn</h2><p>Her name is synonymous with elegance, style and grace. Over the course of her extraordinary life and career, Audrey Hepburn captured hearts around the world and created a public image that stands as one of the most recognizable and beloved in recent memory. But despite her international fame and her tireless efforts on behalf of UNICEF, Audrey was also known for her intense privacy. With unprecedented access to studio archives, friends and colleagues who knew and loved Audrey, bestselling author Donald Spoto provides an intimate and moving account of this beautiful, elusive and talented woman.<br><br>Tracing her astonishing rise to stardom, from her harrowing childhood in Nazi-controlled Holland during World War II to her years as a struggling ballet dancer in London and her Tony Award&#x2013;winning Broadway debut in <i>Gigi</i>, Spoto illuminates the origins of Audrey&#x2019;s tenacious spirit and fiercely passionate nature.<br><br>She would go on to star in some of the most popular movies of the twentieth century, including<i> Roman Holiday</i>, <i>Sabrina</i>, <i>Funny Face</i>,<i> The Nun&#x2019;s Story</i>, <i>Breakfast at Tiffany&#x2019;s</i> and <i>My Fair Lady</i>. A friend and inspiration to renowned designer Hubert de Givenchy, Audrey emerged as a fashion icon as well as a film legend, her influence on women&#x2019;s fashion virtually unparalleled to this day.<br><br>But behind the glamorous public persona, Audrey Hepburn was both a different and a deeper person and a woman who craved love and affection. Donald Spoto offers remarkable insights into her professional and personal relationships with her two husbands, and with celebrities such as Gregory Peck, William Holden, Fred Astaire, Gary Cooper, Robert Anderson, Cary Grant, Peter O&#x2019;Toole, Albert Finney and Ben Gazzara. The turbulent romances of her youth, her profound sympathy for the plight of hungry children, and the thrills and terrors of motherhood prepared Audrey for the final chapter in her life, as she devoted herself entirely to the charity efforts of an organization that had once come to her rescue at the end of the war: UNICEF.<br><br>Donald Spoto has written a poignant, funny and deeply moving biography of an unforgettable woman. At last, <i>Enchantment</i> reveals the private Audrey Hepburn&#x2014;and invites readers to fall in love with her all over again.<br><br>&#x201c;She was as funny as she was beautiful.

He is the author of twenty-one books, including internationally bestselling biographies of Alfred Hitchcock, Tennessee Williams, Marlene Dietrich, Laurence Olivier, Marilyn Monroe and Ingrid Bergman. He is married to the Danish school administrator and artist Ole Flemming Larsen; they live in a quiet village, an hour&#x2019;s drive from Copenhagen.Chapter One <br><br>= <br><br>1929-1939 <br><br>There had been bright sunshine when they left the English shore, but midway across the Channel, dark clouds swept overhead, and the wind had shifted from breezy to almost gale force. Now, as the ship headed for the Continent, they were suddenly caught in a late-winter storm. Cold rain whipped across the deck and stung their faces as the ferry rolled and pitched. Years later, the baroness could not recall feeling any anxiety during the crossing, and therefore she had not communicated any fear to her two small boys as they steadied themselves against her. <br><br>This squall was far less threatening than the typhoon she had once endured in the South China Sea; nor was it as threatening as the violent conditions that routinely battered the ships that had taken her from Asia to South America or from the Netherlands to the East Indies. Thanks to the composure of the Dutch baroness, her eight- and four-year-old sons could face the heavy weather cheerfully. But if she did not hold their hands tightly, the wind might easily sweep the children overboard. Better to take them inside for hot chocolate. <br><br>On her way to the ferry's caf�, the baroness passed her husband in the small, smoky lounge bar. Warming himself with Irish whiskey, he glanced toward her but did not interrupt his conversation with a fellow passenger. Her husband was not the boys' father-they were sons from her <br>rst marriage. And from his dif<br>dence, no one in the room would have guessed that he had any connection to this handsome, patrician woman and her two docile children. She heard him tell his drinking partner that he had left England to take up a new position in Belgium with great prospects. Indeed, she hoped for the best, for him as for herself and the boys: if at last he could hold a job longer than a month or two without succumbing to indolence-well, that might help secure the marriage, too. He was her second husband, and they had been married for three years; during that entire time, she reckoned that he had not worked a total of three months. <br><br>Her <br>rst husband had jumped from the matrimonial ship <br>ve years after their wedding, which was just four years ago, and she was left with two small boys when she was twenty-<br>ve; now, domestic storm clouds were once again on the horizon. And she was seven months pregnant. <br><br>She had some <br>nancial resources and a share of ancestral property, for her family was of old European aristocracy. And she had a title: she was the Dutch Baroness Ella van Heemstra, now also Mrs. Ruston. Dutch baronesses were not a rare breed even in 1929; most democratic Netherlanders did not mind the last of the noble gentry using venerable titles-but only if their holders adopted no airs and graces and imitated the Dutch royal family, an amiably down-to-earth clan. <br><br>The four travelers reached Brussels safely and proceeded to a rented house. There, with the help of a relative who arrived from Holland, the baroness prepared for the child's birth while her husband went off to his job with a British insurance company as a minor clerk with no con<br>dential duties. He was bored from the <br>rst day. <br><br>On the morning of Saturday, May 4, the baroness went into labor, and by mid-afternoon she was nursing her newborn daughter. "Saturday's child works hard for a living," according to Mother Goose. <br><br>Ella, the Baroness van Heemstra, was born in the fashionable Dutch suburb of Velp, near Arnhem, on June 12, 1900. One of nine children, she was the daughter of Baron Arnoud Jan Adolf van Heemstra (once the governor of Dutch Guiana in South America-later Surinam) and his wife, the Baroness Elbrig Wilhelmine Henrietta van Asbeck; both families were titled aristocrats. The precise reasons for the baronetcies remain unclear, but in each case both sets of Ella's grandparents were respected jurists or judges with a long history of service to Crown and country. Their children, Ella's parents, inherited the titles according to the custom of the time. <br><br>Ella's childhood was not underprivileged: her parents owned a country mansion, a city house and a summer cottage, and they employed a small platoon of servants who attended them everywhere. Photos taken of Ella in her mid-twenties show a strikingly attractive woman with <br>ne features, dark hair, a clear, translucent complexion and a certain digni<br>ed smile, neither girlish, coy nor seductive. She was, in other words, every bit the image of a somewhat Germanic-Victorian aristocrat, and it was, of course, the Germanic-Victorian style (overstuffed in furniture and formal in demeanor) that was the standard all over Europe-if not among the royal families, certainly among their social rivals, the landed gentry. <br><br>At the age of nineteen, Ella concluded a respectable but undemanding upper-class education, at which she excelled mostly in singing and amateur theatricals, to the point where she expressed a desire to become an opera singer. Her parents thought little of that and instead purchased her a <br>rst-class ticket on a long steamship journey to visit relatives who worked for Dutch colonial companies in Batavia-the Latin name for the Netherlands, later Jakarta-in the Dutch East Indies (later Indonesia). <br><br>There Ella blossomed and ourished. Much in demand for her <br>ne voice, which she put to good use entertaining at parties; for her clever repartee and her air of sophistication; and for her genteel irtatiousness, Ella impressed many eligible young men and their parents in the colonies. On March 11, 1920-<br>ve months after her arrival and three months before her twentieth birthday-Ella's parents traveled to Batavia for her marriage to Hendrik Gustaaf Adolf Quarles van Ufford, who was six years her senior and held a respectable job. Business was thriving that year in the Indies, at least partly because at home the Netherlands began to experience a severe depression and relied on the colonies more than ever. <br><br>Van Ufford's mother was a baroness with a respected Dutch and French pedigree, and everything augured well for a happy and pro<br>table union. On December 5 of that same year, Ella bore a son they named Arnoud Robert Alexander Quarles van Ufford (always known as Alex); and on August 27, 1924, they welcomed Ian Edgar Bruce Quarles van Ufford. But things soon went very wrong. When Hendrik returned to the Netherlands at Christmas 1924 to discuss a transfer from Batavia, Ella and the toddlers accompanied him. Early in 1925, she and her husband registered their divorce in Arnhem, for reasons that may forever remain unclear. <br><br>At once, van Ufford took ship for San Francisco, where (he said) he had a good offer of work; there, he soon met and married a German immigrant named Marie Caroline Rohde. With that, Hendrik Quarles van Ufford removed himself from the lives of Ella and their two sons; the public record shows only that he returned to the Netherlands years later, where he died on July 14, 1955, at the age of sixty. <br><br>And so, that spring of 1925, the twenty-four-year-old Baroness Ella van Heemstra van Ufford was left with two babies and no husband. Her friends in Holland noted that she had become somewhat imperious, perhaps from defensiveness about the dissolution of her marriage, but she had a title, a Dutch home with her parents and a nanny for her sons. <br><br>These bene<br>ts notwithstanding, Ella surprised her parents by returning to Batavia, and there she renewed a friendship she had earlier formed with a dashing, courtly Englishman she had met even while her marriage was foundering. Joseph Victor Anthony Ruston, eleven years older than Ella, was born November 21, 1889, in Onzic, Bohemia, where his London-born father, Victor John Ruston, had worked and where he had married a local girl named Anna Catherina Wels. Joseph's maternal grandmother's maiden name was Kathleen Hepburn. <br><br>When Joseph and Ella were reunited that spring of 1926, he was still married to Cornelia Wilhelmina Bisschop, a Dutch woman he had married in the East Indies. They were living entirely on her family inheritance, which was certainly helpful, for Ruston never really had any sort of career-nor much of a desire for one. Later identi<br>ed by Hepburn biographers as an Anglo-Irish banker, he was neither Irish nor a banker; "the sad truth is, he never really hung on to any job," according to one of his grandsons. But he had a calm manner, a handsome expression, dark eyes like velvet (according to Ella's description) and, thanks to Cornelia, a <br>ne wardrobe. He sported a little moustache like an artist's brush, and he photographed well; it was not dif<br>cult to understand his appeal to Ella, who in any case was eager to <br>nd a new father for her boys. <br><br>She had every reason to expect that a man with a good job could be found. The direct rule by the Netherlands over the Dutch East Indies had greatly expanded since 1900, and Dutch strategies to control both the economy and tax revenues meant that virtually every exported item was shipped through Batavia. <br><br>Joseph found Ella cultivated, elegant and as enamored of the good life as he, and they enjoyed attending cotillions, military parades, <br>ne restaurants and sporting events. But Ella's greatest appeal was her title-about which he joked so often that she recognized how seriously he took it. Never mind that the title was a centuries-old honori<br>c used by other ladies in Batavia-and never mind that Ella took an of<br>ce job to support herself and her boys. Joseph, besotted with all things that had a trace of the upper classes, took to introducing her as his friend, the baroness. He understood quite clearly that marriage would not promote him to a baronetcy, yet he greatly valued her background and breeding, and perhaps most of all, he saw her family's afuence as a very comfortable cushion in life-indeed, as a plush settee on which he could, when so inclined, rest and relax. <br><br>Cornelia, meanwhile, apparently complaisant and much on her own, luxuriated in the rare<br>ed precincts of colonial life, with a home lavishly appointed i...</p><h2>Chasing the White Dog: An Amateur Outlaw&#39;s Adventures in Moonshine</h2><p><i>Chasing the White Dog</i> is intoxicating look at the inner workings of the moonshine business.</p><p><b>Max Watman </b>is the author of <i>Race Day</i>, which was an editors&#x2019; choice in the <i>New York Times Book Review</i>.

Far from it. &#x2014; THE FOXFIRE BOOK, VOL. 1</p></blockquote> <p>THE FIRST TIME I SAW REN� WITH A JAR OF MOONSHINE, WE were having a beer in an empty bar and gazing at the sun-dappled trees of Tompkins Square Park. It was a quiet afternoon at Doc Holliday&#x2019;s, a honky-tonk in downtown New York City with David Allen Coe on the jukebox, cowboy boots nailed to the ceiling, and cheap PBR. These bars, of which there were maybe half a dozen throughout the city, were headed toward a weird pinnacle of noxious renown: It was 1999, and there were already stories circulating about beautiful celebrities dancing on the bar while the bartenders (gorgeous, wild) poured flaming booze and screamed for their tips through megaphones. </p><p>Ren� is the kid brother of a dear old friend, and in my imagination he is permanently fourteen. His beard, in fact his whole outdoorsy, laid-back, good-looking adult person, surprises me every time. He has wrenched motorcycles and hiked the Appalachian Trail, and he had spent his first paycheck from the Smoky Mountain forestry service to come visit. </p><p>He reached into his knapsack but stopped with his hand in the bag. </p><p>&#x201c;Can I?&#x201d; he asked, his eyes alight. </p><p>His brother shrugged. </p><p>Out came a Mason jar of clear liquid. This was years before I saw white lightning drip from a still in my own kitchen&#x2014;in 1999, a jar of bootleg was a surprise. We took searing sips and shared it with the bartender. </p><p>Years later I took a break from the archives of Appalachian State University to call Ren� and arrange our Labor Day visit in Sylva, North Carolina. He had been trying to line up a series of moonshiners for me to meet, and he had been excited at the prospect of cruising the country roads, meeting the locals, and drinking the legendary &#x201c;charred liquor&#x201d; of the hills. He seemed disappointed with what he&#x2019;d managed. He hadn&#x2019;t found any charred, and all the moonshiners had stopped returning phone calls, as moonshiners are wont to do. We would drive up the mountain to his friend Larry&#x2019;s house&#x2014;he might have some liquor&#x2014;and have a barbecue. It was a fine way to spend Labor Day, I assured him. I could tell he felt that he&#x2019;d failed. </p><p>I followed Ren� up the mountain past small pastures and little homesteads nestled in leafy trees. At about 3,600 feet, we took a left onto a gravel driveway canopied by old-growth forest. A stream crossed the driveway at a ford, and we splashed through it. </p><p>Larry&#x2019;s unassuming rancher is surrounded by bedded plantings. He&#x2019;s built fences of driftwood and strung bottles along them. Arrayed about the property are benches he&#x2019;s cut from entire trees. One of them overlooks his two little ponds&#x2014;one for swimming, one for fish (his teenage son Wesley announced there were twenty-six of them). Up the hill, rows of Christmas trees awaited harvest. He took us into the woods, to a spot on a creek where magnolias grew like mangroves and a small, beautiful waterfall rushed. We talked about recipes for the perfect margarita. </p><p>Larry has tricked out a little wooden barn with a gigantic Peavey PA system, a bar, and a lava lamp. He opened the freezer door and said, &#x201c;Sheeat! Look in here, there&#x2019;s a jar of water that doesn&#x2019;t freeze!&#x201d; </p><p>A neighbor showed up with some shucked oysters from her home in South Carolina. </p><p>We listened to Steve Earle, Ralph Stanley, and AC/DC and poured moonshine over the oysters and shot them with Tabasco. </p><p>Larry mentioned a friend with stovetop still, and praised the famous Smoky Mountain charred. </p><p>I sipped Larry&#x2019;s good corn whiskey&#x2014;and that&#x2019;s what it was, there was no doubt about it&#x2014;and smiled at them and told them this was perfect. A late summer day spent high in the Smokies drinking good white lightning is pretty satisfying. </p><p>It was on this trip that I went in search of famed moonshiner Popcorn Sutton. </p><p>Popcorn Sutton has made a career out of moonshine, but not, or not wholly, in the usual way. Rather than rely upon actually selling jugs of the stuff, he authored the perpetually out-of-print and consistently in demand book <i>Me and My Likker</i> and set out on a mission of bizarre celebrity. He spent a lot of time driving around in a Model A Ford and being interviewed for local news footage about the &#x201c;old ways.&#x201d; </p><p>On Willie Nelson&#x2019;s Web site, you can see Willie with his arm around Popcorn. Willie is dressed nonchalantly in black&#x2014;hoodie, trousers, sneakers, t-shirt, cowboy hat. Popcorn, in contrast, is attired in his usual costume: overalls, a flannel shirt, and a greasy leather fedora. He&#x2019;s hunched, his wild beard radiating down to his chest from drawn cheeks. He can&#x2019;t be an inch over 5 feet 6, and I&#x2019;d be amazed to learn that he weighs more than two cases of beer. He is somewhere between 45 and 105 years old&#x2014;apparently it&#x2019;s a bad idea to ask him. He looks as if he clips Snuffy Smith cartoons to his bathroom mirror. </p><p></p> <p>Lana Nelson (Willie&#x2019;s daughter) captioned the photo: &#x201c;Somewhere in the Great Smoky Mountains near Cherokee, N.C., world renowned moonshiner and literary giant, Popcorn Sutton, visits Dr. Booger Nelson [Willie&#x2019;s nickname is Booger Red] at a top-secret, undisclosed location. Popcorn brews corn liquor for thousands of thirsty customers in the dry county, and received a standing ovation when Dad introduced him at the sold-out Harrah&#x2019;s concert.&#x201d; </p><p>Popcorn never figured out how to monetize his celebrity. He gets hauled up on stage and smiles out into an exultant crowd, but he doesn&#x2019;t get any more bills to stuff in his mattress. He has sold at least one Model A, and he doesn&#x2019;t have the few thousand dollars it would take to get another print run of his book, although the thing is practically a home run, guaranteed to sell out while still warm from the printing press. </p><p>I had figured that his moonshine was all postmodernism, more about performance and presentation than liquor. Certainly, he doesn&#x2019;t actually make liquor for thousands of thirsty customers. He speaks at folk-life festivals. I thought of him as the Andy Warhol of hooch. Just another example of how something that had once been purely American and real had transformed, for purposes of display, into something else. </p><p>The truth turned out to be much weirder. </p><p>Authenticity is evasive and hard to understand in America. Why were there half a dozen honky-tonk beer joints in New York City at the turn of the century? I don&#x2019;t know what to make of the Inner Harbor of Baltimore, Fisherman&#x2019;s Wharf in San Francisco, or the French Quarter in New Orleans. For that matter, I don&#x2019;t know what to make of my own town, in which the historical review board insists that the houses continue to be built as if it were the middle of the nineteenth century, to maintain an authentic cohesion, without stopping to consider that nothing is more artificial than building nineteenth-century houses in the twenty-first century. </p><p>It&#x2019;s a slippery thing. There is no denying that the French Quarter really is the French Quarter or that Fisherman&#x2019;s Wharf is built on the quays. These places have found themselves, due to the pressures of commerce or culture, in a state of aggravated self-consciousness, compelled to emulate and replicate their salient features until artifice overtakes authenticity. </p><p>This shift happens to people, too. My suspicions about Popcorn&#x2019;s artifice were only further underscored by one of the two places he lives, a vacation hub called Maggie Valley, his perfect correlative. </p><p>West of Lake Junaluska in North Carolina, I drove Route 19 between Hard Ridge and Utah Mountain. The asphalt rolled flat for a short stretch between the many hills and became Soco Road. I drove through miles of restaurants, bars, hotels, and gift shops. Maggie Valley, according to the 2000 census, is a town of 607 people. On the five-mile stretch of Soco Road, I counted about thirty restaurants. </p><p>Today every slope is a housing development&#x2014;for vacationers, I assume&#x2014;named, as is the mode for developments, for the very things the bulldozers took from the landscape: Walnut Hills, the Meadows, Wild Acres. The one I explored was a cluster of gray, particleboard-paneled houses stacked like playing cards. </p><p>Whatever Maggie Valley once was, it no longer is. </p><p>The town has commodified itself, just as Popcorn has. I got the feeling that everything I touched, everything I saw, was being done for the benefit of tourists. That feeling is enhanced by the breathtaking tally of the roadside gift shops. Finally, at the edge of town, a gigantic sign in yellow and black announced that I&#x2019;d found the most photographed vista of the Smokies. </p><p>Certainly, this place was perfect for books about backwoods distilling, for stoneware jugs, for metamoonshine. </p><p>But there was one last contradiction: Popcorn had been busted. </p><p>The headline had read, &#x201c;Fire Call Leads to Moonshine Bust: Firefighters Responding to a Cocke County Fire on Tuesday Discovered Much More than They Expected.&#x201d; </p><p>On property belonging to Marvin &#x201c;Popcorn&#x201d; Sutton, they found everything needed to make moonshine, as well as dozens of jugs of the finished product. Three large stills were in operation, and a building on the property was on fire. </p><p>Sutton now faces two charges stemming from Tuesday&#x2019;s bust. Before his arrest, Sutton had gained a certain notoriety for his popular books and videos teaching others how to make moonshine. </p><p>According to one of Popcorn Sutton&#x2019;s videos, he&#x2019;s gotten in trouble for moonshining before&#x2014;in 1974, and again in 1998. </p><p>He&#x2019;s expected to appear before a judge on these most recent charges on May 9. </p><p>Popcorn&#x2019;s shack in Maggie Valley is at the top of a hill, and at the bottom of that hill is the Misty Mountain Ranch, a bed-and-breakfast with a few cabins arrayed around a gravel...</p></p><h2>The Sinners Club</h2><p>It's known as the Sinners Club. . .a private gentlemen's club whose members have mysterious pasts and secret fantasies too hot to reveal. . .<br><br><b>Total Pleasure</b><br><br>Unsure of his reception, Jack Lennox adopts the guise of his own secretary upon returning to his ancestral home to claim his father's earldom.

Hence some amusing scenes of mistaken identity, such as when Lois and Majestic meet and he tells her that she smells. Everything is too different for him, apparently. Later, Superman finds out that Majestic beat up the Green Lantern and is actually a morally ambivalent being, although he does get rid of the time storm.

Weaving together details from the latest scientific research about sharks, giant squid, dragonfish and the huge tube worms, clams and tiny microbes of the deep-sea vents, Hoyt embarks on a magical journey to the bottom of the sea, which is inhabited not by vicious monsters but by diverse species of pale starfish and mud-eating sea cucumbers. Roaming across the abyssal plains and descending deep-sea trenches, he presents as much about the character and charisma of these and other so-called monsters as about the extraordinary world in which they live. The deep sea is not one place but many, and the animals living in each of these marine habitats have developed fascinating and vital ecological relationships with one another. Hoyt unravels the complex predator-prey relationships, from "killer" copepods to battles among giant squid and sperm whales, presenting compelling portraits of animals that are superbly adapted denizens of a dark high-pressure world. There are life-forms, independent of sunlight and photosynthesis, that flourish around the hot, sulfurous deep-sea vents in the magnificent rift valley of the midocean ridge, the world's longest mountain range. Surviving in conditions that appear to be close to the very soup of primordial Earth, these microbes have become the basis for the latest research into the Earth's origins. Fully illustrated with fantastic underwater imagery, Creatures of the Deep will help you enjoy and appreciate the findings and the importance of deep-sea work in the coming decades. The 21st century may well be the era of deep-ocean discovery.<br><i><b>Creatures of the Deep</b></i><b>&nbsp;won the prestigious Outstanding Book of the Year Award from the American Society of Journalists &amp; Authors, Inc., in New York.</b></p><p>Praise for 'Creatures of the Deep': <p>"With good science and history and a clear, fresh voice, Hoyt guides the reader straight down the ocean to the bottom and least known part of Earth." - Edward O.

Indeed this first sketch that many potential owners will have made at some time is the most important part of a design. It needs only the bare bones to be fleshed out and some checks and balances to complete the design process. This may take a little time but it certainly isn't difficult. And the same processes apply for a dinghy as well as a cruising yacht. <p>John Teale takes the reader step-by-step through the stages of designing both power and sailing boats, while also explaining the reasons behind the process. Sketches and reproductions of working drawings are used throughout to help understanding so that by the end of the book even a first time designer's effort can be translated by a builder into a sensible and workmanlike reality. </p><p>Since it was first published, How to Design a Boat has proved itself a bestseller. The second edition simplifies several calculations and introduces new designs.</p>John Teale is a naval architect. He was technical editor of Motor Boat &amp; Yachting for some years. His design work has ranged from fast power boats and motor cruisers, to passenger ferries, fishing boats and cruising yachts.

(Attic Books))</h2><p>From wilderness pioneer to the perils of the oval office, the world of Andrew Jackson comes to vivid life in this scanned reproduction of the 1850 original. <p> Written within just 13 years of Jackson's death, this profound account gives insights into the man nicknamed "Old Hickory" because of his resilient nature. Losing two of his brothers and his widowed mother during the American Revolution, he would rise above both poverty and his limited education to become the seventh president, demonstrating the character necessary to endure the often brutal world of America's early years. </p><p> Jackson's legacy is controversial due to his support for slavery and forced removal of Native Americans from their lands. Exemplifying the rough and hardy qualities of a frontiersman, he would see success on the battlefield, including the brilliant campaign against the British in New Orleans during the War of 1812, survive an attempted assassination as president, and fiercely resist the institution of a national bank. Through much adversity, Jackson showed the world that one could rise above the ashes of suffering in order to fulfill a God-given destiny, extending his influence for years beyond his presidency.</p></p><p>From wilderness pioneer to the perils of the oval office!<p> Andrew Jackson was a popular hero and America's seventh president.

Innes was educated at Oriel College, Oxford, where he was presented with the Matthew Arnold Memorial Prize and named a Bishop Frazer's scholar. After graduation, he went to Vienna to study Freudian psychoanalysis for a year and following his first book, an edition of Florio's translation of 'Montaigne', was offered a lectureship at the University of Leeds. In 1932 he married Margaret Hardwick, a doctor, and they subsequently had five children including Angus, also a novelist. The year 1936 saw Innes as Professor of English at the University of Adelaide, during which tenure he wrote his first mystery story, 'Death at the President's Lodging'. With his second, 'Hamlet Revenge', Innes firmly established his reputation as a highly entertaining and cultivated writer. After the end of World War II, he returned to the UK and spent two years at Queen's University, Belfast, where in 1949 he wrote the 'Journeying Boy', a novel notable for the richly comedic use of an Irish setting. He then settled down as a Reader in English Literature at Christ Church, Oxford, from which he retired in 1973. Innes's most famous character is 'John Appleby', who inspired a penchant for donnish detective fiction that lasts to this day. His other well-known character is 'Honeybath', the painter and rather reluctant detective, who first appeared in 1975 in 'The Mysterious Commission'. The last of the Innes novels, 'Appleby and the Ospreys', was published in 1986, some eight years before his death in 1994. His work is still very highly regarded and 'Appleby's End' and 'The New Sonia Wayward' were chosen by H.R.F. Keating as being amongst the best 100 crime novels ever written.

Marvel at the Dual Slit experiment as a tiny atom passes through two separate openings at the same time. Ponder the peculiar communication of quantum particles, which can remain in touch no matter how far apart. Join the genius jewel thief as he carries out a quantum measurement on a diamond without ever touching the object in question. Baffle yourself with the bizzareness of quantum tunneling, the equivalent of traveling partway up a hill, only to disappear then reappear traveling down the opposite side.

Filled with humor, action, drama, and humanity -- not to mention robots! -- Astro Boy will remind you why comics first grabbed your heart and imagination. In this volume, Astro remains stranded in the 20th century, but he&#39;s certainly not laying about! Astro must save the Earth from a voracious Martian fungus -- and save the intelligent organism from the hydrogen bomb -- all the while having to begin the fight for robot&#39;s rights and to keep robots from fighting each other!</p><p><b>Osamu Tezuka</b> was a Japanese cartoonist, animator, film producer, and activist. Born in Osaka Prefecture, he is best known as the creator of the comics series A<i>stro Boy, Kimba the White Lion</i>,&nbsp;and<i> Black Jack</i>. His prolific output, pioneering techniques, and innovative redefinitions of genres earned him such titles as "the father of manga," "the god of manga," and "kamisama of manga." Additionally, he is often credited as the "godfather of anime" and is considered the Japanese equivalent to Walt Disney, who served as a major inspiration during Tezuka's formative years.</p><h2>Healing Depression &amp; Bipolar Disorder Without Drugs: Inspiring Stories of Restoring Mental Health Through Natural Therapies</h2><p><p>When Gracelyn Guyol was diagnosed in 1993 with a mild form of bipolar disorder, also known as manic depression, she was prescribed a commonly used antidepressant. Soon she developed breast cysts and benign tumors, a possible side effect of the antidepressant. She went off the drug and within two months, her tumors disappeared. </p><p>Under the care of a naturopath, Guyol embarked on a quest to educate herself about the underlying genetic, hormonal, and other causes of depression and bipolar disorder. She investigated many natural therapies-including diet, vitamins, herbal treatments, and energy healing-before finding the solutions that have kept her free of depression and bipolar symptoms since 2002. </p><p><i>Healing Depression &amp; Bipolar Disorder Without Drugs</i> features Gracelyn Guyol's own story and those of thirteen other people around the country who have cured their depression and bipolar disorder using only natural therapies. In-depth research and the expertise of alternative health-care professionals are included in this landmark guide for patients and caregivers seeking responsible, safe alternatives to psychiatric drugs.</p></p><p><p>Gracelyn Guyol is a former public relations executive and this is her first book. She lives in Stonington, Connecticut.</p>Former public relations executive Guyol was determined to be free of psychiatric medication that caused dangerous side effects; that was the catalyst for this guide to the most effective natural remedies for depression and bipolar disorder. Highly detailed sections on frequently overlooked contributors to mental illness relate how many factors&#x2014;low blood sugar; thyroid disease; allergies; vitamin, mineral and hormonal imbalances; <i>Candida albicans</i>; parasites; excess caffeine and sugar consumption; and environmental toxins&#x2014;can cause or exacerbate mental illnesses and such conditions as autism, ADHD and autoimmune diseases. Guyol describes now common alternatives (yoga, meditation, reiki, affirmation, homeopathy) as well as those unfamiliar to many mainstream physicians (glyconutrient supplementation, Nambudripad Allergy Elimination treatments, Mahikari no Waza). The focus is not only on treatment but on recovery. In moving real-life stories, readers will meet people whose illnesses left them incapable of basic functioning yet they continued their search for healing, discovering alternative and mainstream healthcare providers with whom they partnered. While no single treatment cured them, a combination of helpful supports restored their mental, emotional and physical capacities. Guyol's respectful presentation of their tenacity in the face of great obstacles is, perhaps, the main strength of this effort. <i>(Aug.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

I recently prepared this as a party favor for a luncheon of 750 women, and they loved it. Even more note-worthy: I still loved it after making such a huge batch! That says a lot. The combination of sweet and spicy in the popcorn is what makes it different from anything else you&#x2019;ve tasted.<br> &nbsp;<br> Olive oil spray<br> 1� cups shredded unsweetened coconut<br> 3 tablespoons canola oil<br> � cup popcorn kernels<br> 2 cups Candied Peanuts (page 21)<br> 1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter<br> 2 cups packed dark brown sugar<br> � cup light corn syrup<br> 1� teaspoons kosher salt<br> � teaspoon baking soda<br> 3 tablespoons chopped fresh curry leaf (see page 20; optional)<br> 1 teaspoon cumin seeds<br> 1 teaspoon black mustard seeds (see page 78)<br> 1 teaspoon ground turmeric<br> � teaspoon ground mace or nutmeg (optional)<br> � teaspoon paprika<br> � teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional)<br> � teaspoon ground cinnamon<br> &nbsp;<br> Makes 18 cups<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> 1. Preheat the oven to 250�F. Liberally spray an extra-large mixing bowl (not plastic) with olive oil spray.<br> &nbsp;<br> 2. Spread the coconut on a baking sheet and toast it in the oven, stirring it once or twice, until it is golden, about 8 minutes. Set aside to cool, leaving the oven on.<br> &nbsp;<br> 3. Put the oil in a large heavy-bottomed pot, add the corn kernels, and set over medium-high heat. Cover, and shake the pot occasionally until the popping begins, about 5 minutes. Once the popping starts, shake the pot continuously until the popping slows down dramatically, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove the pot from the heat, but continue shaking it until the popping stops entirely. Dump the popcorn into the prepared mixing bowl, trying not to let any unpopped kernels fall into the bowl. Add the toasted coconut and the candied peanuts.<br> &nbsp;<br> 4. Before beginning the caramel process, spray a rubber spatula, a wooden spoon, and 2 cookie sheets liberally with olive oil spray. <br> &nbsp;<br> 5.&nbsp; In a medium saucepan, combine the butter, brown sugar, and corn syrup. Heat over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally with the oil-sprayed spatula, until the butter is melted. Continue cooking, stirring constantly and being careful not to splatter the hot caramel, until the mixture thickens and a candy thermometer registers 255�F, about 7 minutes. (If you do not have a candy thermometer, you will know it is ready when the bubbles of the mixture get noticeably larger and slower.) Remove from the heat. Add the salt, baking soda, curry leaf, cumin seeds, black mustard seeds, turmeric, mace, paprika, cayenne, and cinnamon. Stir quickly to incorporate, and then immediately pour the caramel over the popcorn mixture. Stir with the wooden spoon until all of the popcorn is well coated.<br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br> <b>6. </b>Pour the mixture onto the oiled cookie sheets and spread it out evenly. Bake for 1 hour, stirring it every 20 minutes to keep it from burning.<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>7. </b>Remove the cookie sheets from the oven and let the popcorn cool to room temperature. The popcorn will crisp as it cools.<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>8. </b>When it is cool, you can serve the popcorn immediately or package it in airtight bags for storage.

Its history includes many national personalities well known to baseball fans: Jackie Robinson, Joe DiMaggio, Ted Williams, Casey Stengel, Billy Martin, Walter Johnson, and many more. Their stories are all told in The Golden Game, as well as the stories of the Pacific Coast League, the Japanese-American baseball experience in the state, the origins of the classic baseball poem, "Casey at the Bat," and much, much more.<br><br>An excellent, absorbing read for anyone who loves America's game.</p><p>Featured on NBC's "The Today Show" and National Public Radio. <p>The book that spawned Governor Schwarzenegger to announce September "California Baseball History Month."</p>Honestly--and I don&#39;t mean to toot my own here; well okay, a little--there really is no other book quite like this. California is unique in that the state developed roughly at the same time as baseball itself. Alexander Cartwright, one of the game&#39;s early founders, came to California during the Gold Rush. The Cincinnati Red Stockings, baseball&#39;s first professional team, barnstormed the state after coming here on the Transcontinental Railroad, the monumental nation-building enterprise constructed after the Civil War. So when you tell the California baseball story, as I did here, you are telling in many respects the national baseball story. Even if you don&#39;t live in (or even like) California, if you love baseball, you&#39;ll enjoy this book.</p><h2>The imperial republic: The United States and the world, 1945-1973</h2><p><p><em>The Imperial Republic</em> based as it is on Raymond Aron's realist philosophy, is involved only indirectly or by implication in the disputes about moralism, revisionism, and even imperialism. Its main aim is to account for the diplomacy of the United States as it was in a special time period. Like all diplomacy, it can be explained only within the system of inter-state relations to which the protagonist belongs.</p> <p>United States diplomacy during the twenty- eight year period of 1945-73 is examined from strategic, political, and moral stand points were in diplomats openly declared their aim, and did they achieve it? Does the result justify accusations either of incompetence or of imperialism? Does not the reaction within the United States to a policy which had been a striking success now induce second thoughts about both the policy and its results? The imperial republic is trying to throw off its burden; once a missionary, it has lost the sense of mission; it is still capitalist, but its spoiled children no longer believe in money; it was puritan, but its cities abound in sex shops; it regards itself as scientific, yet mystical and nudist sects are common.</p> <p>The reader is not asked to endorse Aron's paradoxical interpretations, but to try to discover the reasons for any disagreement he may feel regarding differences in political judgment. People who have acquired the habit of thinking of the contemporary world in Manichaean terms-in terms of the reduction of whole populations to slavery by monsters, or in terms of capitalism, imperialism, or revisionism- may be out raged by a book that is not concerned with grounds for outrage and in which there are neither villains nor heroes; but rather with mixed messages by decent policymakers.

That all changed in less than a generation with the discovery and development of a new category of medicine known as antibiotics. By 1955, the age-old evolutionary relationship between humans and microbes had been transformed, trivializing once-deadly infections.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;William Rosen captures this revolution with all its false starts, lucky surprises, and eccentric characters. He explains why, given the complex nature of bacteria&#x2014;and their ability to rapidly evolve into new forms&#x2014;the only way to locate and test potential antibiotic strains is by large-scale, systematic, trial-and-error experimentation. Organizing that research needs large, well-funded organizations and businesses, and so our entire scientific-industrial complex, built around the pharmaceutical company, was born.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; <i>T</i>imely, engrossing, and eye-opening, <i>Miracle Cure</i> is a must-read science narrative&#x2014;a drama of enormous range, combining science, technology, politics, and economics to illuminate the reasons behind one of the most dramatic changes in humanity&#x2019;s relationship with nature since the invention of agriculture ten thousand years ago.</p><p><b>William Rosen</b>, author of <i>The Third Horseman</i>, <i>Justinian&#x2019;s Flea</i>, and <i>The Most Powerful Idea in the World</i>, was an editor and a publisher at Macmillan, Simon &amp; Schuster, and the Free Press for nearly twenty-five years.&#x201c;Rosen&#x2019;s highly informed retelling captures the drama of scientists&#x2019; quest, against long odds, to find and produce bacteria-killing drugs&#x2014;and the egos, ambitions, brilliance and resolve that drove them. . . . It is a strength of &#x201c;Miracle Cure&#x201d; that Rosen places its many tales of discovery in their larger contexts . . . an important contribution to a still-germane yet fast-receding history. And it&#x2019;s all the more impressive that Rosen, formerly a book editor and publisher, wrote it as he was battling his own intractable disease.&#x201d;<b><br><b>&#x2014;<i>The Wall Street Journal</i></b><br><br></b>&#x201c;In <i>Miracle Cure</i>, William Rosen tells the lavish story of antibiotics with the flair and skill of a seasoned novelist, portraying his characters as all too-human, the research often fallible but occasionally transcendent. . . . Rosen's chronological approach gives the narrative its fluency; his wit and vivid detail make <i>Miracle Cure</i> an absorbing read. . . . A triumph of science writing that deserves a broad popular audience.&#x201d;<b><br><b><b>&#x2014;<i>Minneapolie Star Tribune</i></b></b><br><br>"</b>In this assured chronicle of the twentieth-century antibiotics revolution, William Rosen delivers reams of science at a thrilleresque pace.

It is a product of long hours and intelligent design, of meaningful work enviroments and particular rules and principles. For too long we have thought of intuition as a kind of black box at the very core of who we are and why we act the way we do. This book shows us how we can hone our instinctive ability to know in an instant, helping us to bring out the best in our thinking and become better decision-makers in our homes, offices and in everyday life. Just as he did with his revolutionary theory of the tipping point, Gladwell reveals how the power of blink&#39; could fundamentally transform our relationships, the way we consume, create and communicate, how we run our businesses and even our societies.You&#39;ll never think about thinking in the same way again.</p><p><i>Blink</i> is about the first two seconds of looking--the decisive glance that knows in an instant. Gladwell, the best-selling author of <i>The Tipping Point</i>, campaigns for snap judgments and mind reading with a gift for translating research into splendid storytelling. Building his case with scenes from a marriage, heart attack triage, speed dating, choking on the golf course, selling cars, and military maneuvers, he persuades readers to think small and focus on the meaning of "thin slices" of behavior. The key is to rely on our "adaptive unconscious"--a 24/7 mental valet--that provides us with instant and sophisticated information to warn of danger, read a stranger, or react to a new idea. <p> Gladwell includes caveats about leaping to conclusions: marketers can manipulate our first impressions, high arousal moments make us "mind blind," focusing on the wrong cue leaves us vulnerable to "the Warren Harding Effect" (i.e., voting for a handsome but hapless president). In a provocative chapter that exposes the "dark side of blink," he illuminates the failure of rapid cognition in the tragic stakeout and murder of Amadou Diallo in the Bronx. He underlines studies about autism, facial reading and cardio uptick to urge training that enhances high-stakes decision-making.

Reading level: 4.8.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i></p><p>Mistress Mary is quite contrary until she helps her garden grow. Along the way, she manages to cure her sickly cousin Colin, who is every bit as imperious as she. These two are sullen little peas in a pod, closed up in a gloomy old manor on the Yorkshire moors of England, until a locked-up garden captures their imaginations and puts the blush of a wild rose in their cheeks; "It was the sweetest, most mysterious-looking place any one could imagine. The high walls which shut it in were covered with the leafless stems of roses which were so thick, that they matted together.... 'No wonder it is still,' Mary whispered. 'I am the first person who has spoken here for ten years.'" As new life sprouts from the earth, Mary and Colin's sour natures begin to sweeten. For anyone who has ever felt afraid to live and love, <i>The Secret Garden</i>'s portrayal of reawakening spirits will thrill and rejuvenate. Frances Hodgson Burnett creates characters so strong and distinct, young readers continue to identify with them even 85 years after they were conceived. <i>(Ages 9 to 12)</i>What secrets lie behind the doors at Misselthwaite manor? Recently arrived at her uncle's estate, orphaned mary Lennox is spoiled, sickly, and certain she won't enjoy living there. Then she discovers the arched doorway into an overgrown garden, shut up since the death of her aunt ten years earlier. Mary soon begins transforming it into a thing of beauty--unaware that she is changing too.<p></p><p>But Missalthwaite hides another secret, as Mary discovers one night. High in a dark room, away from the rest of the house, lies her young cousin Colin, who believes he is an incurable invalid, destined to die young. His tantrums are so frightful, no one can reason with him. If only, Mary hopes, she can get Colin to love the secret garden as much as she does, its magic wil work wonders on him.</p></p><h2>The Bridge of Years: A Novel</h2><p><p><strong>"Beautifully wrought . . . deeply felt and significant in theme." &#x2015;<em>Saturday Review</em></strong></p> This novel, first published in 1946, is one of May Sarton's earliest and, some critics think, one of her best.

Paul, her husband, is a philosopher, detached, moody, continually embroiled in the spiritual conflicts of a crumbling Europe.<br><br> The last years before the second war are tense ones, a time for stock-taking, for a quickening of the pace of life. But it is M�lanie who encourages her family to proceed with their plans, to continue with their way of life.

Introducing a cast of known and unknown characters, George B. Dyson traces the course of the information revolution, illuminating the lives and work of visionaries-from the time of Thomas Hobbes to the time of John von Neumann-who foresaw the development of artificial intelligence, artificial life, and artificial mind. This deep and elegant book derives both its title and its outlook from Samuel Butlers 1863 essay Darwin Among the Machines. Observing the beginnings of miniaturization, self-reproduction, and telecommunication among machines, Butler predicted that natures intelligence, only temporarily subservient to technology, would resurface to claim our creations as her own. Updating Butlers arguments, Dyson has distilled the historical record to chronicle the origins of digital telecommunications and the evolution of digital computers, beginning long before the time of Darwin and exploring the limits of Darwinian evolution to suggest what lies beyond. Weaving a cohesive narrative among his brilliant predecessors, Dyson constructs a straightforward, convincing, and occasionally frightening view of the evolution of mind in the global network, on a level transcending our own. Dyson concludes that we are in the midst of an experiment that echoes the prehistory of human intelligence and the origins of life. Just as the exchange of coded molecular instructions brought life as we know it to the early earths primordial soup, and as language and mind combined to form the culture in which we live, so, in the digital universe, are computer programs and worldwide networks combining to produce an evolutionary theater in which the distinctions between nature and technology are increasingly obscured. Nature, believes Dyson, is on the side of the machines.</p><p>Here's a mesmerizing account of the evolution of machines and thoughts about machines, woven into a story about the evolution of intelligence. <i>Darwin Among the Machines</i> is not so much about how today's intelligence came to be, but about how it may further develop as humanity and computer grow closer together. George Dyson tells the story largely through stories--both historical and legendary--from the lives of scientists and philosophers who paved the way for today's cybernetics revolution, starting with the 17th-century insights of Thomas Hobbes. This book challenges the assumption that nature and machine are opposing forces. Dyson believes them to be allies.<p><b>George Dyson</b> is a historian of technology and the author of <i>Turing&#x2019;s Cathedral</i>, <i>Baidarka</i>, and <i>Project Orion</i>.

Dwork (Holocaust Studies and Modern Jewish History/Clark Univ.) and van Pelt (Cultural History/Univ. of Waterloo, Ontario) present both the historical, cultural, and architectural plans of the Nazis for Auschwitz. The entire surrounding region of Upper Silesia had been long targeted to be wrested from Poland and returned to Germany, whose claims extended back to the conquests of 13th-century Teutonic knights. The area referred to as ``the German East'' by Josef Goebbels was to become a rural paradise for redirected Germans, while the local Poles were to be expelled, exploited for slave labor, and ultimately exterminated. Even more damning than Daniel Jonah Goldhagen's controversial new study, Hitler's Willing Executioners, this book makes clear that thousands of transportation workers, accountants, Farben employees, engineers, architects, and builders were as conscious of the lethal goals of Auschwitz as Himmler or Hitler. In the slower-paced cremations of murder victims in 1940, for example, the camp utilized ``an efficient and technologically advanced doubled-muffle . . . coke-heated furnace from Topf and Sons for 9,000 marks'' with ``the capacity to incinerate seventy bodies in twenty-four hours.'' With ``one wash barrack per 7,800 inmates and one latrine hut per 7,000,'' it is argued that degradation and disease were not incidental, but that ``the design was, in fact, lethal.'' The pride of the gathered architects of Auschwitz-Birkenau is successfully captured in a group photo, as is the sincerity of a Polish nun in 1990 comparing the campgrounds to the sanctity of Golgotha. If the amalgam of insightful historical analysis and exhaustive pictorial and financial documentation is challenging for students of this period, just think of the difficult reading facing Holocaust deniers. Scores of van Pelt's photos and enhanced plans and blueprints supplement the lengthy notes in this peerless work of documentation and research that sheds new light on this century's darkest address. -- <i>Copyright �1996, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>Founded by Germans in 1270 and sold to Polish King Casimir IV in 1457, the small provincial town of Auschwitz (Oswiecim in Polish) became a pawn in power struggles between Poland, Germany, Bohemia and Hungary. When Hitler annexed this border town to the Reich in 1939 as German troops smashed Poland, the Nazis celebrated their push to reclaim the "German East," a mythologized, racially pure domain once contested by medieval knights of the Teutonic Order, who ruled Prussia in the 13th century after virtually exterminating the native population and repopulating the town with Germans. The concentration camp established in Auschwitz's suburbs in 1940-designed as a transit camp for Poles being shipped west as slave laborers-was soon transformed into an extermination camp for killing Jews. Using 224 photographs and architectural plans, as well as oral histories of survivors, this careful, detached study traces the camp's evolution into a site where more than one million people were killed and through January 1945, when the remaining 60,000 prisoners underwent a forced march into Germany.

After getting a note demanding his presence, Federal Agent Aaron Falk arrives in his hometown for the first time in decades to attend the funeral of his best friend, Luke. Twenty years ago when Falk was accused of murder, Luke was his alibi. Falk and his father fled under a cloud of suspicion, saved from prosecution only because of Luke&#x2019;s steadfast claim that the boys had been together at the time of the crime. But now more than one person knows they didn&#x2019;t tell the truth back then, and Luke is dead. Amid the worst drought in a century, Falk and the local detective question what really happened to Luke. As Falk reluctantly investigates to see if there&#x2019;s more to Luke&#x2019;s death than there seems to be, long-buried mysteries resurface, as do the lies that have haunted them. And Falk will find that small towns have always hidden big secrets.</p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of January 2017:</strong> I was surprised to realize that <em>The Dry</em> was Jane Harper's debut novel. The writing is fantastic, and the plot - where many mystery/thrillers fall short these days - was completely unpredictable in the best ways possible. Federal Agent, Aaron Faulk, returns to his hometown in Australia to mourn, and inevitably investigate, his best friend's apparent suicide. What comes next is a series of twists and turns that will keep you guessing all the way until the end. I repeatedly found myself shocked and pulled in by Harper's fast paced and engrossing writing. Truly a fantastic read and hopefully the first of many to come from Ms. Harper. <em>--Penny Mann, The Amazon Book Review</em>Jane Harper is the author of The Dry, winner of various awards including the 2015 Victorian Premier&#39;s Literary Award for an Unpublished Manuscript, the 2017 Indie Award Book of the Year, the 2017 Australian Book Industry Awards Book of the Year Award and the CWA Gold Dagger Award for the best crime novel of 2017.

David Small takes a tongue-in-cheek look at Washington's plunge into politics in GEORGE WASHINGTON'S COWS, a rhyming picture book.

Stir in a serving of cheerful music, the hooting of an owl, the tinkle of china, and the snorting of Washington's helpful hogs and the bleating of his learned sheep, and this will be a favorite read-along during February and all through the year.

Not that knowing would do him any good.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He had a watch once, a gold one, French or Swiss or something like that, European, but he hasn&#x2019;t seen it since he got here. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wherever here is.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why are the blinds angled that way? The woman who pretends to be a nurse said it was to keep the sun from shining into his eyes and waking him up in the morning. When he asked her to open them so he could see the sky, she&#x2019;d ducked her head and said, &#x201c;Mmm-hmmm,&#x201d; the way she always does when she means no. Her uniform has an old stain, the color of tea and shaped like a flying bird, over her right breast, and the surgical mask she always wears is smeared with dark lipstick on both sides, as though she puts it on without looking at it. Usually the edges of the red imprint curve up in a kind of smile. It&#x2019;s the same mask and the same uniform day after day after day. She wears the nurse&#x2019;s cap at an angle he supposes is meant to be jaunty, so far to one side that it requires a glittering little fence of bobby pins to keep it in place.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He hasn&#x2019;t seen her face since he woke up in this bed, although he saw it several times before, even knew her name, or at any rate a name she used. But now it&#x2019;s the mask, the lipstick, the cap, the &#x201c;Mmm-hmmm&#x201d;s. So in addition to trying to track the time of day, he&#x2019;s been worrying about what the mask might mean.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She hasn&#x2019;t opened the blinds. Still, a few days ago&#x2014;four? six?&#x2014;he&#x2019;d noticed that the room gets a little brighter during the day, and he&#x2019;s pretty sure that it would get <i>dimmer </i>if his room were on the sunrise side of the hospital. So there, his mind <i>is </i>still working. Despite all the shit they&#x2019;re pumping into him. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Except, he thinks, he might have realized it twice. Or even three times. It&#x2019;s hard to keep track. But the most recent time the thought had presented itself, he&#x2019;d marked it mentally, the way he used to do when he was in business and drowning in information; he tied it to something everyday. The client with the pointed nose was Mr. Byrd; the office suite was 321, the <i>final countdown </i>in that awful, unforgettable song. It always worked. So this time he chose &#x201c;Sunday,&#x201d; putting all the energy he could summon into chalking it on the wall in his mind. <i>Sunday. </i>Sun day. <i>The </i>sun <i>brightens as the </i>day <i>goes on: Sunday.</i><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So now he knows she lied to him about the blinds; if the sunlight ever reached his bed, it would be in the early evening, just before it set. And there&#x2019;s one <i>other </i>thing that she&#x2019;s not aware he knows. There&#x2019;s water outside. For a few hours every day, probably when the sun is highest, the ceiling just above the window <i>ripples</i>. It&#x2019;s got to be the sun, reflected off water and bouncing up through the angled blinds.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A <i>klong</i>, maybe? Bangkok is full of them, a fractal tangle of waterways, mostly brown and usually sluggish, with a thick skin of casual sewage despite recent cleanup campaigns, afloat on water from the Chao Phraya, the river that splits the city in two, like the center of a giant blighted butterfly: the river its spine, its wings the filthy city through which the <i>klongs </i>meander. So knowing that there&#x2019;s a <i>klong </i>out there&#x2014;if there is&#x2014;doesn&#x2019;t help much. Hell, it could be a swimming pool.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His nose itches. Now that he can&#x2019;t reach it, it always itches. The woman who&#x2019;s not a nurse cuffed both his hands to the frame of the hospital bed the day he tried to remove the IV drip. He&#x2019;d guessed that whatever mixtures of dope they were giving him, they were in the drip. So he&#x2019;d crimped the tube and then given it a yank, but it had set off some kind of alarm, and she&#x2019;d come in with the doctor right behind her. The doctor, who was the size of a house, <i>enormous </i>for a Thai, had the cuffs in his hand. That was early on the day&#x2014;he&#x2019;s <i>almost </i>certain it was the same day&#x2014;that he woke up, maybe eight hours later, with a cast on his left leg. Hard as he tries, and he hasn&#x2019;t got much else to do, he can&#x2019;t remember breaking it.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She put in a new drip an hour or so ago, her mask upside down today so the corners of the red lip print angle down. The room seems to be changing size: bigger, smaller, bigger, smaller. His eyes close.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>What </i>was it about Sunday?</p><h2>Vietnam North</h2><p>A first hand account of North Vietnam during the Vietnam War.</p><p></p><h2>Freedom from cancer: The amazing story of vitamin B-17, or Laetrile</h2><p>Freedom from cancer: The amazing story of vitamin B-17, or Laetrile.</p><p></p><h2>The Meaning of Happiness: The Quest for Freedom of the Spirit in Modern Psychology and the Wisdom of the East</h2><p>Synthesizes scientific and mystical discoveries to show how total knowledge and acceptance of oneself can lead to spiritual enlightenment and union with God</p><p></p><h2>Collins Gem Sas Survival Guide</h2><p>Whether lost on a mountain, trapped in your car by a blizzard or stranded in a desert, this book is designed as the ideal guide to survival.

To commemorate twenty years of thrilling <i>Star Trek</i> novels, Pocket Books is proud to present a one-of-a-kind tribute volume highlighting the most unforgettable moments from a generation of bold explorations by some of the most imaginative science fiction authors of our time! <br> Selected by an expert <i>Star Trek</i> fan, <i>Star Trek: Adventures In Time and Space</i> contains page after page of terrific <i>Star Trek</i> moments. Over the course of two decades, Pocket Books has published hundreds of fantastic adventures set in the astounding universes of <i>Star Trek, Star Trek: The Next Generation�, Star Trek: Deep Space Nine�,</i> and <i>Star Trek: Voyager�.</i> Here is the cr�me de la cr�me of Starfleet's literary voyages: the most dramatic confrontations, the strangest aliens, the most deadly perils that ever tested Kirk, Picard, Sisko, Janeway, and their valiant crews. <br> Journey backwards through time to sample the best the future has to offer! <br> SPECIAL BONUS FEATURE: The <i>Star Trek</i> Novel Chronology, showing where each book falls in the grand <i>Star Trek</i> saga -- <i>because readers demanded it!</i></p><p>It's a concept that shouldn't have worked: excerpts from the best of the <i>Star Trek</i> novels, grouped under such categories as The Crew, Visions of the Future and Aliens, and Allies and Enemies. After all, these segments of <i>Trek</i> narratives were designed to be read in context, weren't they? It's a tribute to Mary P. Taylor's editing skills, however, that this turns out to be a truly delightful volume, with the various extracts chosen so cannily that the final effect is of an exhilarating, world-spanning saga, with each section adding fresh insights. Of course, the segments that grip most compulsively are those by the most authoritative writers (such as Sherman and Schwartz's wonderful study of Spock in <i>Vulcan's Forge</i> and Steven Barnes's adaptation of a TV episode, <i>Far Beyond the Stars</i>. But such is Taylor's skill at picking the best: there are no episodes that are less than rewarding. It's also an intelligent touch to strip-mine the galactic derring-do with passages on the creation of the various TV series and movies. Here again, enthusiasts will find much to cherish (not least in the section by The Man himself, Gene Rodenberry). The final effect of the book, though, is to confirm the continuing vigor of a concept that shows every sign of lasting until the futuristic era it depicts. <i>--Barry Forshaw, Amazon.co.uk</i><b>Mary P.

In <i>Spent</i> Geoffrey Miller applies this revolutionary science's principles to a new domain: the sensual wonderland of marketing and status seeking that we call American consumer culture. Starting with the basic notion that the goods and services we buy unconsciously advertise our biological potential as mates and friends, Miller examines the hidden factors that dictate our choices in everything from lipstick to cars, from the magazines we read to the music we listen to. With humor and insight, Miller analyzes an array of product choices and deciphers what our decisions say about ourselves, giving us access to a new way of understanding-and improving-our behaviors. Like <i>Freakonomics</i> or <i>The Tipping Point, Spent</i> is a bold and revelatory book that illuminates the unseen logic behind the chaos of consumerism and suggests new ways we can become happier consumers and more responsible citizens.<br><br></p><p>Follow me on twitter @matingmindAuthor of The Mating Mind (2001) and Spent: Sex, Evolution, and Consumer Behavior (2009); co-editor of Mating Intelligence (2007).

In venues such as factories and community halls, people encountered industrial, educational, training, advertising, and other types of &#x201c;useful cinema.&#x201d; Screening these films transformed unlikely spaces, conveyed ideas, and produced subjects in the service of public and private aims. Such functional motion pictures helped to shape common sense about cinema&#x2019;s place in contemporary life. Whether measured in terms of the number of films shown, the size of audiences, or the economic activity generated, the &#x201c;non-theatrical sector&#x201d; was a substantial and enduring parallel to the more spectacular realm of commercial film. In <i>Useful Cinema</i>, scholars examine organizations such as UNESCO, the YMCA, the Amateur Cinema League, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art. They also consider film exhibition sites in schools, businesses, and industries. As they expand understanding of this<i> other </i>American cinema, the contributors challenge preconceived notions about what cinema is.<br> <br>Contributors. Charles R.

Lit Guild, BOMC, Mystery Guild, &amp; Doubleday Main.</p><p>Be aware: this is not your typical Patricia Cornwell novel. Not only is there no Kay Scarpetta, but <i>Isle of Dogs</i> is a comic romp, a real departure for this author. It does center around a couple of characters from past books--police chief Judy Hammer and reporter-turned-cop Andy Brazil of <i>Hornet's Nest</i> and <i>Southern Cross</i>. But the plot, style, and tone will remind you more of Carl Hiaasen's dark comedies.<p> The madcap doings get underway when the addled, nearly blind governor of Virginia confusedly launches a speed-trap program on isolated Tangier Island, whose prickly, eccentric residents promptly attempt secession. Cornwell adeptly interweaves other crisscrossing plot lines involving a gang of street-stupid thugs gunning for Hammer and Brazil, an angel-faced serial killer, a kidnapped dog, and more. She does miss a few beats: the pacing sags during certain episodes, and at times the writing strains so hard for laughs that instead it draws winces.

The plot, legendary&#x201d; (USA Today). <br><br>Among the writers are Academy Award -winning and -nominated actors and actresses and other personalities from the worlds of entertainment and popular culture. Each celebrity contribution is illustrated with a stunning piece of art by illustrators who have created some of the most treasured classics of children's literature-Caldecott Medal and Honor winners, Kate Greenaway Award winners, Pulitzer Prize -winning cartoonist, New Yorker cover contributors, and many other internationally esteemed artists.<br><br>The contributors' talents are outshined only by their generosity: All of the royalties and contributors' fees from this book have been donated to Starbright, an innovative charitable foundation committed to improving the lives of seriously ill children. The result is a gift book like no other, a glorious celebration for the whole family.<br></p><p>Hans Christian Andersen's "The Emperor's New Clothes," first published in 1837, has been told and retold in hundreds of ways, but never, ever by such a star-studded cast of scribes and artists as this. Sure, we still get the vainglorious, fashion-obsessed Emperor who is duped into parading down the street in an "invisible suit of clothes." And, of course, we still welcome the Honest Boy, the only one with enough gumption to point out that the Emperor's fancy-pants birthday suit is exactly that--a birthday suit. In this quirky, comical version, however, the story is crafted from the diverse, occasionally vulgar, often charming narrative perspectives of the Emperor's entire entourage--from his servants to the Spinning Wheel to the Imperial Dresser's spectacles to His Royal Highness's own underwear--all of whom have very good, self-invested reasons for not wanting to reveal that the Emperor's new clothes are nonexistent, however expensive. A smart-alecky moth, drawn by the beloved illustrator Quentin Blake, ironically patches holes in the piecemeal narrative with smoothing, if not soothing, transitions. <p> Each snippet of story--doused in shameless punnery--is performed on the audio CD by one of 23 celebrities, including Jay Leno (the Moth), Madonna (the Empress), Fran Drescher (the Heralding Horn), Jeff Goldblum (the Imperial Wizard), Robin Williams (the Court Jester), and Calvin Klein (the Emperor's Underwear). The Honest Boy? Steven Spielberg himself, the creative director of this ambitious enterprise designed to benefit the Starbright Foundation for seriously ill children. If the startling display of glitterati isn't enough to spark your interest, then the truly astounding, fresh, full-page art of 23 preeminent children's book illustrators (including Maurice Sendak, Mark Teague, Chris Van Allsburg, Tomie dePaola, and William Joyce) surely will. The bumblingly hilarious accents of the celebrity narrators, combined with the whimsical and eclectic musical effects, make this quite an auditory treat. Though the words on the pages and those on the audio CD don't exactly match, the combined experience of a favorite old story, clever narrative play, gorgeous artwork, and just plain silliness will amuse kids ages 8 to 108.

Details of construction methods and materials are included for all the main types of building that have featured on Britain's military airfields. These include aircraft hangars, control towers, armouries, guardhouses, parachute stores, training establishments and domestic buildings such as barracks and messes.<br>The locations of many surviving examples of building types are given, including those that have been listed for their historic and/or architectural importance. The birth of military air traffic control is also described as this had a significant influence on the design of certain types of building.<br>The rapid development, progress and growth of British aviation, from its inception through to the introduction of jet aircraft, can be seen clearly in this detailed study of its infrastructure. This book will therefore be an invaluable source of reference for all who are interested in military aviation and the history of the Royal Air Force in particular.</p><p></p><h2>New England Frontier: Puritans and Indians, 1620-1675</h2><p>A study of Puritan principles, their application on the New England frontier, and their effect on the Indian society</p><p>In contrast to most accounts of Puritan-Indian relations, New England Frontier argues that the first two generations of Puritan settlers were neither generally hostile toward their Indian neighbors nor indifferent to their territorial rights. Rather, American Puritans - especially their political and religious leaders - sought peaceful and equitable relations as the first step in molding the Indians into neo-Englishmen. When accumulated Indian resentments culminated in the war of 1675, however, the relatively benign intercultural contact of the preceding fifty-five-year period rapidly declined. With a new introduction updating developments in Puritan-Indian studies in the last fifteen years, this third edition affords the reader a clear, balanced overview of a complex and sensitive area of American history.<p><strong>Alden T. Vaughan, </strong>Professor Emeritus of History at Columbia University is the author or editor of numerous books, including <em>The Puritan Tradition in America, 1620-1730, New</em> <em>England's Prospect, </em>and <em>Puritans among the Indians.</em></p></p><h2>Doomed to Die</h2><p>Inspector Luke Thanet investigates the murder of Perdita Master--a woman who, before her death, had felt a sense of impending doom</p><p>Dorothy Simpson worked as a French teacher and then as a marriage-guidance counsellor, before turning to writing full time.

In another of Simpson&#39;s cerebral and humanistic mysteries, Thanet&#39;s investigation of the crime, which has a skilled twist at conclusion, displays his usual steady methodology. Terence Hardiman narrates at a similarly steady pace. His vocalizations for young people, women and the various policemen are equally good. Speech patterns subtly change to distinguish characters, augmenting Simpson&#39;s fine, descriptive character development. Listeners can follow dialogue and narrative passages easily. Chivers&#39;s usual fidelity adds to the program, which is sure to appeal to Simpson fans and any listeners who like their mysteries in traditional English style. R.F.W.

She followed this success with Letourneau&#39;s Used Auto Parts and the epic Merry Men. Her nonfiction work has appeared in the New York Times, the Nation, and elsewhere, and she has written about the militia movement in Maine, where she lives with her husband, Michael, and various furry creatures.Chute's new novel is a slice-of-life story cut from the middle of the loaf. Loosely structured around the interactions and relationships of Big Lucien Letourneau, owner of the Miracle City junkyard, and his family, neighbors, and assorted hangers-on, the novel seems a series of barely connected sketches. The absence of a coherent point of view further diminish Chute's undeniably vivid language and clear eye for the details of life on the margins of society. Still, the immediacy of the prose evokes in startling clarity the amoral jumble of passions and the suffering of characters whose lives seem at once so different and yet so much like our own. Librarians should consider, given the interest in Chute's first novel, The Beans of Egypt, Maine ( LJ 3/15/87). Linda L.

Ariol is your everyday tween donkey with blue glasses. He lives in the suburbs with his mom and dad. His best friend is a pig. He&#39;s in love with a beautiful cow in his class. His teacher is a dog. His gym teacher is a huge rooster. In short, Ariol is just like you and me.

Guibert lives in Paris with his wife and daughter.</p><p>Originating from Burgundy (as do the best snails), <b>Marc Boutavant</b> now lives and works in Paris. His work springs from a wry observation of life and the interaction of his friends and children. Their quirks of personality, mannerisms and reactions to situations are transposed into his characters.</p>Though he produced such thoughtful adult fare as Alan&#x2019;s War (2008) and The Photographer (2009), French author Guibert is also known for the exceedingly child-centric series Sardine in Outer Space. Ariol and his ensemble are a more Earth-bound cast of anthropomorphized animal children, but the author continues to display a deep understanding of what makes kids tick. He goes in a far less fantastical direction in these 10 10-page stories, originally from France, which offer subtly humorous slice-of-life vignettes. Whether Ariol is joining his father for a trip to the ATM, arguing with a friend about sneakers, accompanying his grandmother to the movies, pursuing his great crush, or emulating his favorite superhero, the author dares to depict the exclusionary, argumentative, self-centered ways children can sometimes behave, without giving up an iota of their charm. There is even a piece that touches on racism, letting animal species bear the brunt of the offenses, which could prove a great boon to many classroom discussions. Collaborator Boutavant captures the manic internal life of Ariol and friends with fun, deceptively childlike art.

Like many synesthetes around the world, I learned to keep them to myself. Thus I'm grateful for the present day climate of inquiry into and wonder about this nearly forgotten gift. And while traditional medicine has always fascinated me, and research on this topic is currently burgeoning around the world, I knew I must also call on consciousness, spiritual and even quantum&nbsp;experts. As someone who lived inside the experience, I knew that anatomy alone did not, could not, hold all the answers.

Maureen earned a BA in journalism with a minor in Spanish from Penn State University, and a certificate of superior-level Spanish from the Universidad Complutense de Madrid."<i>Tasting the Universe</i> is not only the brilliant writing of a top, professional journalist looking in on a strange but romantic phenomena, but it is the writing of a person who could embrace the feelings of those she interviews, because author Seaberg herself possesses this remarkable gift of synesthesia.

He has frequently contributed essays and op-ed pieces to publications such as the <i>New York Times</i>, <i>Washington Post</i>, <i>Vanity Fair</i>, <i>The New Yorker</i>, and <i>The Atlantic</i>.Scott Turow&#39;s latest legal thriller is a sequel to his 1987 blockbuster, PRESUMED INNOCENT, in which DA Rusty Sabich was accused of murdering his lover, another female prosecutor. Twenty-three years later, Rusty is now an appellate judge; despite his best intentions, he&#39;s involved in another affair and soon finds himself accused of murdering his wife, whom he finds dead in their bed. There are so many twists and turns in this one you&#39;ll never guess what really happened. The story is expertly narrated from the main characters&#39; points of view by Edward Herrmann in the male parts and Orlagh Cassidy as the female characters (though Cassidy gets no written billing). Herrmann masterfully portrays the stoic Savich, his confused adult son, and the relentless defense lawyer Sandy Stern, who is weakened by cancer. Cassidy is superb as Anna, Savich&#39;s new lover, and Marta, Stern&#39;s daughter, who bolsters her father&#39;s defense team. The frequent switches in point of view have the potential to be confusing, but the dual narrators make them work. Although this is clearly a sequel, one needn&#39;t have read PRESUMED INNOCENT to enjoy it. Further, the quality of the writing is high, and the narration sterling.

Olds is naked before us, curious and brave and even generous toward the man who was her mate for thirty years and who now loves another woman. As she writes in the remarkable &#x201c;Stag&#x2019;s Leap,&#x201d; &#x201c;When anyone escapes, my heart / leaps up. &nbsp;Even when it&#x2019;s I who am escaped from, / I am half on the side of the leaver.&#x201d; Olds&#x2019;s propulsive poetic line and the magic of her imagery are as lively as ever, and there is a new range to the music&#x2014;sometimes headlong, sometimes contemplative and deep. Her unsparing approach to both pain and love makes this one of the finest, most powerful books of poetry she has yet given us.</p></p><p>Sharon Olds was born in San Francisco and educated at Stanford University and Columbia University. Her first book, <i>Satan Says </i>(1980), received the inaugural San Francisco Poetry Center Award. Her second, <i>The Dead and the Living, </i>was both the Lamont Poetry Selection for 1983 and winner of the National Book Critics Circle Award. <i>The Father </i>was short-listed for the T. S. Eliot Prize in England, and <i>The</i> <i>Unswept Room </i>was a finalist for the National Book Award and the National Book Critics Circle Award. Olds teaches in the Graduate Creative Writing Program at New York University and helped to found the NYU workshop program for residents of Goldwater Hospital on Roosevelt Island, and for veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan. She lives in New Hampshire and in New York City.<b>The Last Hour</b><br><br>Suddenly, the last hour <br>before he took me to the airport, he stood up, <br>bumping the table, and took a step <br>toward me, and like a figure in an early <br>science fiction movie he leaned <br>forward and down, and opened an arm, <br>knocking my breast, and he tried to take some <br>hold of me, I stood and we stumbled, <br>and then we stood, around our core, his <br>hoarse cry of awe, at the center,<br>&nbsp;at the end, of our life. Quickly, then, <br>the worst was over, I could comfort him, <br>holding his heart in place from the back <br>and smoothing it from the front, his own <br>life continuing, and what had <br>bound him, around his heart&#x2014;and bound him <br>to me&#x2014;now lying on and around us,<br>&nbsp;sea-water, rust, light, shards, <br>the little eternal curls of eros <br>beaten out straight.<br><b>Stag&#x2019;s Leap</b><br><br>Then the drawing on the label of our favorite red wine <br>looks like my husband, casting himself off a <br>cliff in his fervor to get free of me. <br>His fur is rough and cozy, his face<br>placid, tranced, ruminant, <br>the bough of each furculum reaches back <br>to his haunches, each tine of it grows straight up <br>and branches, like a model of his brain, archaic, <br>unwieldy. He bears its bony tray <br>level as he soars from the precipice edge, <br>dreamy. When anyone escapes, my heart <br>leaps up. Even when it&#x2019;s I who am escaped from, <br>I am half on the side of the leaver. It&#x2019;s so quiet, <br>and empty, when he&#x2019;s left.

I feel like his victim, <br>and he seems my victim, I worry that the outstretched <br>legs on the hart are bent the wrong way as he <br>throws himself off. Oh my mate. I was vain of his <br>faithfulness, as if it was <br>a compliment, rather than a state <br>of partial sleep. And when I wrote about him, did he <br>feel he had to walk around <br>carrying my books on his head like a stack of <br>posture volumes, or the rack of horns <br>hung where a hunter washes the venison <br>down with the sauvignon? Oh leap, <br>leap! Careful of the rocks! Does the old <br>vow have to wish him happiness <br>in his new life, even sexual<br>joy? I fear so, at first, when I still <br>can&#x2019;t tell us apart. Below his shaggy <br>belly, in the distance, lie the even dots <br>of a vineyard, its vines not blasted, its roots <br>clean, its bottles growing at the ends of their <br>blowpipes as dark, green, wavering groans.<br><b>My Son&#x2019;s Father&#x2019;s Smile</b><br><br>In my sleep, our son, as a child, said, <br>of his father, <i>he smiled me</i>&#x2014;as if into <br>existence, into the family built around the <br>young lives which had come from the charged <br>bouquets, the dense oasis. That smile, <br>those years, well what can a body say, I have <br>been in the absolute present of a fragrant <br>ignorance. And to live in those rooms, <br>where one of his smiles might emerge, like something <br>almost from another place, <br>another time, another set <br>of creatures, was to feel blessed, and to be <br>held in mysteriousness, and a little <br>in mourning. The thinness of his lips gave it <br>a simplicity, like a child&#x2019;s drawing <br>of a smile&#x2014;a footbridge, turned over on its back, or seen <br>under itself, in water&#x2014;and the archer&#x2019;s <br>bow gave it a curved unerring <br>symmetry, a shot to the heart. I look back on that un- <br>clouded face yet built of cloud, <br>and that waning crescent moon, that look <br>of deep, almost sad, contentment, and know myself <br>lucky, that I had out the whole <br>night of a half-life in that archaic <br>hammock, in a sky whose darkness is fading, that <br>first dream, from which I am now waking.</p><h2>Linear Algebra &amp; Differential Equations Second Custom Edition for University of California, Berkeley (Math 54 - 2013)</h2><p>Suitable for Math 54 at UC Berkeley.

Several works have become nearly as iconic as Angelou herself: the inspiring &#x201c;On the Pulse of Morning,&#x201d; read at President Bill Clinton&#x2019;s 1993 inauguration; the heartening &#x201c;Amazing Peace,&#x201d; presented at the 2005 lighting of the National Christmas Tree at the White House; and &#x201c;Mother,&#x201d; which beautifully honors the first woman in our lives. Angelou writes of celebrations public and private; included in this volume are a bar mitzvah wish to her nephew and a birthday greeting to Oprah Winfrey.<br> More than a writer, Angelou is a chronicler of history, an advocate for peace, and a champion for the planet, as well as a patriot, a mentor, and a friend. To be shared and cherished, the wisdom and poetry of Maya Angelou prove there is always cause for celebration.</p><p></p><h2>The body in the Library</h2><p>Spine creased, page edges tanned.

Done- gal, in 1933. No trace of the professor was ever found. Over the decades stories of Porter&#39;s disappearance turned into legend. A strong swimmer and always fond of the outdoors, was it likely that Porter had been drowned by misadventure or was foul play involved? Perhaps Porter took off alone to pursue new adventures? By the late 1920s Porter and his wife Lucy possessed every asset that most mortals can only dream of. But was there a dark secret that led the enigmatic professor to jump from the rocks on that fateful morning? The truth about the secret inner world of Arthur Kingsley Porter has only recently been revealed.

Although emotional affairs often do not include physical intimacy, they can take away from the relationship by encouraging one partner to get his or her emotional needs met elsewhere, and by bringing secrecy and deception into the relationship, which damages trust just as surely as if the partner had slept with the other person.</p> <p>Emotional affairs share three characteristics:</p> �Emotional intimacy. Transgressors share more of their inner self, frustrations and triumphs than with their spouses. They are on a slippery slope when they begin sharing the dissatisfaction with their marriage with a co-worker.<br> �Secrecy and deception. They neglect to say, <em>We meet every morning for coffee</em>. Once the lying starts, the intimacy shifts farther away from the marriage.<br> �Sexual chemistry. Even though the two may not act on the chemistry, there is at least an unacknowledged sexual attraction.<br> <p></p> <p>Often, people whose partners have emotional affairs either don't feel like they have a right to put an end to it (after all, the other person is just a friend and not a lover), or they have to contend with the cheating person's evasions and justifications (we work together, we're not having an affair), and accusations that the jealousy or insecurity is not justified. It can be difficult to think of an emotional affair as a problem, even if it's causing the partner worry, jealousy, insecurity, and the loss of emotional connection to the cheating partner.</p> <p>This book helps the reader explore whether or not the partner is having an emotional affair and then offers steps to discovering the roots of the problem, making changes in the relationship, discussing the issue with the cheating partner, and recovering from the breach of trust and intimacy caused by the affair.</p></p><p>Even without the complication of sexual infidelity, affairs of the heart can damage the stability and intimacy of a relationship.

Written into young minds through constant repetition, letters soon function like water in a fishbowl&#x2014;essential for life, but too familiar to qualify as objects of serious inquiry. But considered separately from words and sentences, letters express their own mysterious beauty. In order to uncover their secrets, it is necessary to forego the conventional historical approach in favor of an impassioned appreciation of their formal and sensual characteristics. <p>In <em>Letter by Letter</em> graphic designer and calligrapher Laurent Pflughaupt analyzes each letter of the Roman alphabet in detail, tracing its origin, evolution, and form, as well as discussing its important abbreviations, symbols, and associated meanings. Arranged in alphabetical order, twenty-six entries offer a wealth of facts about each letter, establishing correspondences between letters and elements borrowed from a variety of different fields of study, ranging from traditional paleography, phonetics, and graphic arts to the more arcane areas of musicology, esotericism, and even Eastern philosophy. In addition to a glossary, timelines and images allow us to visualize the letters during the different historical eras, giving the reader an appreciation of their successive metamorphoses. Written as an homage, this lovingly illustrated book takes a broad approach to the modern alphabet, allowing the reader to see letters anew, in a fresh and lively manner guaranteed to inform and enchant anyone interested in typography and language.</p></p><p>Laurent Pflughaupt is a designer, calligrapher, and artist.

Since type is now so integrated into our everyday lives, it is imperative we be more in the know--indeed, literate--about how letter forms developed and typefaces came to be. <i>Letter by Letter</i> by Laurent Pflughaupt, a designer and calligrapher who studied at l'Ecole Municipale Superieure des Arts et Techniques in Paris, is a Baedaeker of letters from "A" to "Z." Although readers won't find Arial (the favorite default sans-serif on the computer) or Zapf Dingbats (the most commonly used typographic ornaments, at least on the Macintosh), they will be told about the calligraphic and engraved origins of the Western alphabet, particularly the Roman letter, with such clarity (and a touch of raciness) that even the notice will be appreciative. -- <i>New York Times, 6/1/2008</i><br><br>Few books have really explored the meaning, origins and aesthetic of individual letters in the Roman alphabet. Pflughaupt, a Parisian designer, calligrapher and artist, examines the very form of these building blocks that make our language possible, providing a rich and unusual background that combines paleography, phonetics, graphic arts and even musicology. While this book has been written for artists and linguists, the information contained within will enhance the knowledge of anyone who reads or writes using this particular alphabet. --Book News Inc., August 2008</p><h2>Autumn Splendor: Folk Art Quilts and Projects</h2><p>Celebrate the pleasures of autumn days by stitching a charming patch of squash, a cornucopia of flowering delights and more.

Water-soluble and oil-based coloured pencils are becoming increasingly popular for botanical painting as they are easier to use than traditional watercolour and are more forgiving, yet they produce the same stunning effects. They are especially suitable for the accuracy needed to paint in the botanical style of illustration. In this book Ann Swan gives helpful advice on all aspects of working with coloured pencils, including the techniques you will have to master - underpainting, layering and burnishing. She also demontrates how to mix and build up colour, and how to add those finishing touches that will complete your painting successfully. Several full step-by-step demonstrations are included to show how these techniques are put into practice. The book concludes with a gallery of coloured pencil works by the author, students of botanical painting and other professional botanical painters, providing a wonderful source of reference and inspiration.</p><p>(back cover) <br> This beautifully illustrated book is the first practical guide to creating botanical artworks with colored pencils. Easier to use and more forgiving than traditional watercolor, water-soluble and oil-based colored pencils have become increasingly popular among botanical artists because of the many stunning effects they can produce. <br> <br> Ann Swan, a well-known botanical artist and a top exponent of the genre, teaches the techniques of burnishing, underpainting, and layering with detailed step-by-step demonstrations. She also provides a gallery of colored pencil works that serve as a wonderful source of reference and inspiration for students and professional botanical painters at all levels. <br> <br>Ann Swan works primarily in coloured pencils and is well known for her work in this medium. She is a member of the prestigious Society of Botanical Artists and has been awarded several Silver Gilt and Gold Medals by the RHS for her work. She exhibits her work worldwide, including The Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew, and the Chelsea and Hampton Court Flower Shows in London. She teaches regularly at her studio in Wiltshire and runs popular painting holidays and courses, in both the UK and the US.</p><h2>Photography of the 20th Century</h2><p>Images of the century (TASCHEN&#39;s 25th anniversary special edition) The history of photography began some 150 years ago, but only relatively recently has it been fully recognised as a medium in its own right. Cologne&#39;s Museum Ludwig was the first museum of contemporary art to devote a substantial section to international photography. The L. Fritz Gruber collection, from which this book is drawn, is one of the most important in Germany and one of the most representative anywhere in the world, constituting the core of the museum&#39;s holdings. This book provides a fascinating insight into the collection&#39;s rich diversity; from conceptual art to abstraction to reportage, all of the major movements and genres are represented via a vast selection of the century&#39;s most remarkable photographs. From Ansel Adams to Piet Zwart, over 850 works are presented in alphabetical order by photographer, with descriptive texts and photographers&#39; biographical details.</p><p></p><h2>Bambi (The Beloved Classic)</h2><p>This is a tale of exceptional charm</p><p></p><h2>Walter&#39;s Purple Heart</h2><p>The author of Pay It Foward serves up a romantic story about a dead World War II soldier who transcends the barriers of time to touch the live of the people he loved in his life. 40,000 first printing.</p><p>Catherine Ryan Hyde is the author of thirty published and forthcoming books. Her bestselling novel Pay It Forward, adapted into a major Warner Bros. motion picture starring Kevin Spacey and Helen Hunt, made the American Library Association&#39;s Best Books for Young Adults list.<p><b>Chapter One </b></p><p><b> <i>Walter</i></b> </p><p> Usually when the hero dies the story is over. Until I get half my head blown off, this story can't even begin. </p><p> Don't think I have a big ego, just because I call myself a hero. Anybody can be a hero after they're dead, even me. So, you see, there's an upside to being found dead at the opening credits. There's also a price tag. </p><p> But anyway, I'm holding up the story. I should hurry up and die. </p><p> Before I do, I need to stress a point. None of this was my idea. I was minding my own business from the word go. </p><p> This first small part I'll blame on the radio. After that it all falls squarely into Andrew's court. Andrew masterminded the whole disaster. I'm the kind of guy goes along for the ride. People say I should break that pattern, and maybe they're right, only I won't live long enough to try. </p><p> Here's where a good life fell down. </p><p> It's the coldest part of the year, December, with a wind like dry ice across the boardwalk, and Andrew and me, we're leaning on my dad's Ford. Nobody out but us and the seagulls, because honestly, who else would be so much the fool? </p><p> Andrew spins the dial on the car radio, settles on a station playing "String of Pearls." Cranks it up full blast. Me, I'm busy trying to get my damn Lucky lit against that high, cold wind, working with these fingers I can't even feel. </p><p> Then the music stops, and then the man comes on the radio and tells it. </p><p> Then I'm as good as dead. </p><p> Now most folks, they wouldn't blame that part on the radio. They'd likely blame it on the Japs. </p><p> Me, I like to put things in a real perspective. Tragic stuff happens every day, all over the world, but if you don't tell me, I won't know. Andrew won't know. Then Andrew won't need to run off half-cocked, and I won't have to go along for the ride. </p><p> Some people say I don't have to do anything unless I want to, but they're them. They don't know what it is to be me. </p><p> I'm holding up the story again. I should get on with the dying. </p><p> I could tell you where I am and how I got here, but I'd only be wasting your time. The real people, the live ones, the ones who own this story once I'm gone, they'll get to that soon enough. And get to it, and get to it. Live people get real into wheres and hows and whats. It's like a hobby with them. </p><p> Did I mention that this all happened decades ago? Sometimes I forget to mention the most basic things. </p><p> And I know when I talk about it, it doesn't sound decades old. I know I talk about it like I'm in it, right now. Like it's happening. And there's a reason for that. But it's hard to explain to anybody who isn't dead. Think of it like this: You know how there's time, and you have to be in one certain place in it? Well, that's you. That's not me. </p><p> Anyway, that radio thing, that was the beginning of a good life falling down. Now I'll tell you how it ends. </p><p> This is where I am. </p><p> I'm wading in a swamp in a jungle. Andrew's there, plus about ten other guys from my outfit. One goes ahead, one behind, to watch for crocodiles. If they see one, they shoot it. We also got scorpions, wasps, some giant mosquitoes, but nobody to protect us from them. Every man for himself. </p><p> The swamp stinks. The whole goddamned island stinks, like something used to be alive under there, only not recently. </p><p> We stumble up onto dry land. </p><p> We got our rifles slung over our shoulders now, nice and easy, and I'm lighting up a smoke. Because, see, we just heard that the Tokyo Night Express came and stole the last of our Japs. </p><p> We're on a cakewalk. </p><p> We're headed back to Henderson Field, relieved of the worst duty known to man, flushing well-armed Japs out of caves on Mt. Austen. You never really know how awful a job is until that magic moment when you get to stop. </p><p> Morale is way up. </p><p> We walk in clusters, talking, laughing; somebody chews on me about something, but I'm too happy to listen or care. </p><p> It's the first time I've been happy since I got out of the hospital, no, since Hutch lobbed the mortar round that put me there. No, since I took the action that put me dead center on that round. But I forgot. I don't talk about that. Most things I'll tell you, but I'm not so sure about that. </p><p> I'm sorry if I come off a little bitter. </p><p> Then the shot. </p><p> I take it. I'm always the lucky guy. </p><p> It tears through the sleeve of my jacket and burns into my arm like a trail of fire. The impact of it spins me a quarter turn. Maybe. Or maybe it's the surprise that turns me, or some kind of knowing that I wouldn't believe until just now. </p><p> It feels like the bullet. </p><p> Now that I'm turned, I'm staring down the muzzle of an American Browning. Trouble is, the boy on the ground behind it's not an American. Not even close. </p><p> I'm dead, only I don't know it yet. </p><p> It might take me forty years or so to figure it out. </p><p> Maybe you're wondering at this point, like, how did a Jap boy lay hold of an American-made weapon, or how did he happen to miss the Tokyo Express. Here you have the advantage of me. They are very good questions, and I'd like to wonder them myself, but I'm busy dying. </p><p> Everything after this happens in slow motion. </p><p> A round leaves the muzzle of the gun, aimed at my forehead. I watch it fly. </p><p> I send a short message to my feet. It's garbled in panic. I'm afraid when it finally gets there, they won't understand. </p><p> I decide it doesn't matter, because whatever my feet do with the information will be better than what they're doing now. </p><p> I wonder how long a message takes to travel from a brain to a pair of feet. I never had to wonder before, because the world has never moved so slowly, never broken down into such obvious and specific and carefully planned sequences. </p><p> I decide that if it's longer than a round of ammunition takes to travel from the muzzle of a Browning M-2 to a forehead some thirty feet away, the answer will come up moot. </p><p> Then I decide the bullet is winning. </p><p> I'm sure you think there isn't time to know all this in the flight time of the bullet, but excuse me, you're alive. You'll have to trust me. I've been places you think you haven't. </p><p> The best news I can give you is that it doesn't hurt. Death never does. Sometimes the moments leading up to it can be painful, but the dying is always easy. </p><p> I feel it as impact. </p><p> It feels, actually, like an inside job. Like some pressure within my head causes it to explode. </p><p> It throws me over backwards. </p><p> I'm flying back through the air now, thinking I will land. Because, you see, I still think I'm alive, and that the old laws of inevitability will have some meaning for me. </p><p> I have to land. </p><p> I don't. </p><p> Because somewhere on the way down there ceases to be Walter, so who is this person I think must land? </p><p> Then I sit up. </p><p> Am I confusing you? Well, I'm sorry, but at this point there's no reason for you to be any clearer on all this than I am. </p><p> Okay, here, I'll sketch it out for you as best I can: Somebody sits up, and it's me, but it's not Walter. And this body on the ground does not sit up. Because that's Walter, and he's dead. </p><p> Better? Good. I knew I could clear things up. </p><p> Ordinarily, I think, souls are not commonly known to sit up. They like to float, fly, that sort of thing. They are not often found acting bodylike. I think my soul is experiencing a moment of confusion. Some sort of final identity crisis. </p><p> I look around at the body. Who was this poor fool again? What on earth happened to the rest of his head? I can't imagine. </p><p> I watch Andrew as he tries to pull the body to cover. Watch him risk his life for an empty. </p><p> It hits me, what I am. What I can do. What I don't have to do. There's a special kind of freedom to that moment. I could never in a million years describe it to you. </p><p> I watch Andrew pretend this boy with half a head will make it, watch him wade through a line of fire, unhit, empty body in tow. </p><p> I see his guilt and rage and pain, not just now, but stretched to infinity. It's not a disturbing image. In fact, it's strangely beautiful. It's something he needs to do, and even the most painful aspects of it -- especially the most painful aspects -- are just exquisite. </p><p> Me, I'm free. </p><p> I take off flying. </p><p> Over the jungle, which no longer stinks or threatens. Over the tops of millions of palm trees. Over a blue-green ocean too perfect to host violence. </p><p> Okay. </p><p> Now we can get on with it. </p><p> Now we are at the beginning. </p><p> It makes no difference whether you believe all this or you don't. It not only makes no difference to me, but to anything. Things don't wait for you to believe them. They happen. </p><p> God is not Tinkerbell. </p><p> He does what he does whether you clap your hands or hide behind the comfort of your disbelief. </p><p> Besides, you know all this. You just forgot. </p><p> Copyright � 2002 by Catherine Ryan Hyde</p></p><h2>Things That I Do in the Dark</h2><p>Tender, witty, and passionate poems express impressions of human scenes, often colored by an awareness of race</p><p></p><h2>Christ and Krishna</h2><p>This book is a comparison of non-sectarian philosophical relationships between the teachings of Krisha, The God of Love and Jesus Christ.</p><p></p><h2>The Road Not Taken: Finding America in the Poem Everyone Loves and Almost Everyone Gets Wrong</h2><p><b>A cultural &#x201c;biography&#x201d; of Robert Frost&#x2019;s beloved poem, arguably the most popular piece of literature written by an American</b><br><br><i>&#x201c;Two roads diverged in a yellow wood . . .&#x201d;</i> One hundred years after its first publication in August 1915, Robert Frost&#x2019;s poem &#x201c;The Road Not Taken&#x201d; is so ubiquitous that it&#x2019;s easy to forget that it is, in fact, a poem. Yet poetry it is, and Frost&#x2019;s immortal lines remain unbelievably popular. And yet in spite of this devotion, almost everyone gets the poem hopelessly wrong.<br>&nbsp;<p>David Orr&#x2019;s<i> The Road Not Taken </i>dives directly into the controversy, illuminating the poem&#x2019;s enduring greatness while revealing its mystifying contradictions. Widely admired as the poetry columnist for<i> The New York Times Book Review,</i> Orr is the perfect guide for lay readers and experts alike. Orr offers a lively look at the poem&#x2019;s cultural influence, its artistic complexity, and its historical journey from the margins of the First World War all the way to its canonical place today as a true masterpiece of American literature.<br>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;The Road Not Taken&#x201d; seems straightforward: a nameless traveler is faced with a choice: two paths forward, with only one to walk. And everyone remembers the traveler taking &#x201c;the one less traveled by, / And that has made all the difference.&#x201d; But for a century readers and critics have fought bitterly over what the poem really says. Is it a paean to triumphant self-assertion, where an individual boldly chooses to live outside conformity? Or a biting commentary on human self-deception, where a person chooses between identical roads and yet later romanticizes the decision as life altering?</p><p></p><p>What Orr artfully reveals is that the poem speaks to <i>both </i>of these impulses, and all the possibilities that lie between them. The poem gives us a portrait of choice without making a decision itself. And in this, &#x201c;The Road Not Taken&#x201d; is distinctively American, for the United States is the country of choice in all its ambiguous splendor.<br><br>Published for the poem&#x2019;s centennial&#x2014;along with a new Penguin Classics Deluxe Edition of Frost&#x2019;s poems, edited and introduced by Orr himself&#x2014;<i>The Road Not Taken </i>is a treasure for all readers, a triumph of artistic exploration and cultural investigation that sings with its own unforgettably poetic voice.</p></p><p>David Orr is the poetry columnist for <i>The New York Times Book Review</i>. He is the winner of the Nona Balakian Prize from the National Book Critics Circle, and his writing has appeared in<i> The New Yorker</i>, <i>Poetry</i>, Slate, and<i> The Yale Review</i>.

He pauses, his hands in his pockets, and looks back and forth between his options. As he hesitates, images from possible futures flicker past: the young man wading into the ocean, hitchhiking, riding a bus, kissing a beautiful woman, working, laughing, eating, running, weeping. The series resolves at last into a view of a different young man, with his thumb out on the side of a road. As a car slows to pick him up, we realize the driver is the original man from the crossroads, only now he&#x2019;s accompanied by a lovely woman and a child. The man smiles slightly, as if confident in the life he&#x2019;s chosen and happy to lend that confidence to a fellow traveler. As the car pulls away and the screen is lit with gold&#x2014;for it&#x2019;s a commercial we&#x2019;ve been watching&#x2014;the emblem of the Ford Motor Company briefly appears.</p><p>The advertisement I&#x2019;ve just described ran in New Zealand in 2008. And it is, in most respects, a normal piece of smartly assembled and quietly manipulative product promotion. But there is one very unusual aspect to this commercial. Here is what is read by a voice-over artist, in the distinctive vowels of New Zealand, as the young man ponders his choice:</p><p>Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,</p><p>And sorry I could not travel both</p><p>And be one traveler, long I stood</p><p>And looked down one as far as I could</p><p>To where it bent in the undergrowth;</p><p>Then took the other, as just as fair,</p><p>And having perhaps the better claim,</p><p>Because it was grassy and wanted wear;</p><p>Though as for that the passing there</p><p>Had worn them really about the same,</p><p>And both that morning equally lay</p><p>In leaves no step had trodden black.</p><p>Oh, I kept the first for another day!</p><p>Yet knowing how way leads on to way,</p><p>I doubted if I should ever come back.</p><p>I shall be telling this with a sigh</p><p>Somewhere ages and ages hence:</p><p>Two roads diverged in a wood, and I&#x2014;</p><p>I took the one less traveled by,</p><p>And that has made all the difference.</p><p>It is, of course, &#x201c;The Road Not Taken&#x201d; by Robert Frost. In the commercial, this fact is never announced; the audience is expected to recognize the poem unaided. For any mass audience to recognize any poem is (to put it mildly) unusual. For an audience of car buyers in New Zealand to recognize a hundred-year-old poem from a country eight thousand miles away is something else entirely.</p><p>But this isn&#x2019;t just any poem. It&#x2019;s &#x201c;The Road Not Taken,&#x201d; and it plays a unique role not simply in American literature, but in American culture&#x2014;and in world culture as well. Its signature phrases have become so ubiquitous, so much a part of everything from coffee mugs to refrigerator magnets to graduation speeches, that it&#x2019;s almost possible to forget the poem is actually a poem. In addition to the Ford commercial, &#x201c;The Road Not Taken&#x201d; has been used in advertisements for Mentos, Nicorette, the multibillion-dollar insurance company AIG, and the job-search website Monster.com, which deployed the poem during Super Bowl XXXIV to great success. Its lines have been borrowed by musical performers including (among many others) Bruce Hornsby, Melissa Etheridge, George Strait, and Talib Kweli, and it&#x2019;s provided episode titles for more than a dozen television series, including <i>Taxi</i>, <i>The Twilight Zone</i>, and <i>Battlestar Galactica</i>, as well as lending its name to at least one video game, Spry Fox&#x2019;s <i>Road Not Taken</i> (&#x201c;a roguelike puzzle game about surviving life&#x2019;s surprises&#x201d;). As one might expect, the influence of &#x201c;The Road Not Taken&#x201d; is even greater on journalists and authors. Over the past thirty-five years alone, language from Frost&#x2019;s poem has appeared in nearly two thousand news stories worldwide, which yields a rate of more than once a week. In addition, &#x201c;The Road Not Taken&#x201d; appears as a title, subtitle, or chapter heading in more than four hundred books by authors other than Robert Frost, on subjects ranging from political theory to the impending zombie apocalypse. At least one of these was a massive international bestseller: M. Scott Peck&#x2019;s self-help book <i>The Road Less Traveled: A New Psychology of Love, Traditional Values and Spiritual Growth</i>, which was originally published in 1978 and has sold more than seven million copies in the United States and Canada.</p><p>Given the pervasiveness of Frost&#x2019;s lines, it should come as no surprise that the popularity of &#x201c;The Road Not Taken&#x201d; appears to exceed that of every other major twentieth-century American poem, including those often considered more central to the modern (and modernist) era. Admittedly, the popularity of poetry is difficult to judge. Poems that are attractive to educators may not be popular with readers, so the appearance of a given poem in anthologies and on syllabi doesn&#x2019;t necessarily reveal much. And book sales indicate more about the popularity of a particular poet than of any individual poem. But there are at least two reasons to think that &#x201c;The Road Not Taken&#x201d; is the most widely read and recalled American poem of the past century (and perhaps the adjective &#x201c;American&#x201d; could be discarded). The first is the Favorite Poem Project, which was devised by former poet laureate Robert Pinsky. Pinsky used his public role to ask Americans to submit their favorite poem in various forms; the clear favorite among more than eighteen thousand entries was &#x201c;The Road Not Taken.&#x201d;</p><p>The second, more persuasive reason comes from Google. Until it was discontinued in late 2012, a tool called Google Insights for Search allowed anyone to see how frequently certain expressions were being searched by users worldwide over time and to compare expressions to one another. Google normalized the data to account for regional differences in population, converted it to a scale of 1 to 100, and displayed the results so that the relative differences in search volume would be obvious. Here is the result that Google provided when &#x201c;The Road Not Taken&#x201d; and &#x201c;Frost&#x201d; were compared with several of the best-known modern poems and their authors, all of which are often taught alongside Frost&#x2019;s work in college courses on American poetry of the first half of the twentieth century:</p><p>According to Google, then, &#x201c;The Road Not Taken&#x201d; was, as of mid-2012, at least four times as searched as the central text of the modernist era&#x2014;<i>The Waste Land</i>&#x2014;and at least twenty-four times as searched as the most anthologized poem by Ezra Pound. By comparison, this is even greater than the margin by which the term &#x201c;college football&#x201d; beats &#x201c;archery&#x201d; and &#x201c;water polo.&#x201d; Given Frost&#x2019;s typically prickly relationships with almost all of his peers (he once described Ezra Pound as trying to become original by &#x201c;imitating somebody that hasn&#x2019;t been imitated recently&#x201d;), one can only imagine the pleasure this news would have brought him.</p><p>But as everyone knows, poetry itself isn&#x2019;t especially widely read, so perhaps being the most popular poem is like being the most widely requested salad at a steak house. How did &#x201c;The Road Not Taken&#x201d; fare against slightly tougher competition? Better than you might think:</p><p>The results here are even more impressive when you consider that &#x201c;The Road Not Taken&#x201d; is routinely misidentified as &#x201c;The Road Less Traveled,&#x201d; thereby reducing the search volume under the poem&#x2019;s actual title. (For instance, a search for &#x201c;frost&#x2019;s poem the road less traveled&#x201d; produces more than two hundred thousand results, none of which would have been counted above.) Frost once claimed his goal as a poet was &#x201c;to lodge a few poems where they will be hard to get rid of&#x201d;; with &#x201c;The Road Not Taken,&#x201d; he appears to have lodged his lines in granite. On a word-for-word basis, it may be the most popular piece of literature ever written by an American.</p><p>____</p><p>AND ALMOST EVERYONE gets it wrong. This is the most remarkable thing about &#x201c;The Road Not Taken&#x201d;&#x2014;not its immense popularity (which is remarkable enough), but the fact that it is popular for what seem to be the wrong reasons. It&#x2019;s worth pausing here to underscore a truth so obvious that it is often taken for granted: Most widely celebrated artistic projects are known for being essentially what they purport to be. When we play &#x201c;White Christmas&#x201d; in December, we correctly assume that it&#x2019;s a song about memory and longing centered around the image of snow falling at Christmas. When we read Joyce&#x2019;s <i>Ulysses</i>, we correctly assume that it&#x2019;s a complex story about a journey around Dublin as filtered through many voices and styles. A cultural offering may be simple or complex, cooked or raw, but its audience nearly always knows what kind of dish is being served.</p><p>Frost&#x2019;s poem turns this expectation on its head. Most readers consider &#x201c;The Road Not Taken&#x201d; to be a paean to triumphant self-assertion (&#x201c;I took the one less traveled by&#x201d;), but the literal meaning of the poem&#x2019;s own lines seems completely at odds with this interpretation. The poem&#x2019;s speaker tells us he &#x201c;shall be telling,&#x201d; at some point in the future, of how he took the road less traveled by, yet he has already admitted that the two paths &#x201c;equally lay / In leaves&#x201d; and &#x201c;the passing there / Had worn them really about the same.&#x201d; So the road he will later call less traveled is actually the road <i>equally </i>traveled. The two roads are interchangeable.</p><p>According to this reading, then, the speaker will be claiming &#x201c;ages and ages hence&#x201d; that his decision made &#x201c;all the difference&#x201d; only because this is the kind of claim we make when we want to comfort or blame ourselves by assuming that our current position is the product of our own choices (as opposed to what was chosen for us, or allotted to us by chance). The poem isn&#x2019;t a salute to can-do individualism; it&#x2019;s a commentary on the self-deception we practice when constructing the story of our own lives. &#x201c;The Road Not Taken&#x201d; may be, as the critic Frank Lentricchia memorably put it, &#x201c;the best example in all of American poetry of a wolf in sheep&#x2019;s clothing.&#x201d; But we could go further: It may be the best example in all of American <i>culture</i> of a wolf in sheep&#x2019;s clothing.</p><p>In this it strongly resembles its creator. Frost is the only major literary figure in American history with two distinct audiences, one of which regularly assumes that the other has been deceived. The first audience is relatively small and consists of poetry devotees, most of whom inhabit the art form&#x2019;s academic subculture. For these readers, Frost is a mainstay of syllabi and seminars, and a regular subject of scholarly articles (though he falls well short of inspiring the interest that Ezra Pound and Wallace Stevens enjoy). He&#x2019;s considered bleak, dark, complex, and manipulative; a genuine poet&#x2019;s poet, not a historical artifact like Longfellow or a folk balladeer like Carl Sandburg. While Frost isn&#x2019;t the most esteemed of the early-twentieth-century poets, very few dedicated poetry readers talk about him as if he wrote greeting card verse.</p><p>Then there is the other audience. This is the great mass of readers at all age levels who can conjure a few lines of &#x201c;The Road Not Taken&#x201d; and &#x201c;Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening,&#x201d; and possibly &#x201c;Mending Wall&#x201d; or &#x201c;Birches,&#x201d; and who think of Frost as quintessentially American in the way that amber waves of grain are quintessentially American. To these readers (or so the first audience often assumes), he isn&#x2019;t bleak or sardonic but rather a symbol of Yankee stoicism and countrified wisdom. This audience is large. Indeed, the search patterns of Google users indicate that, in terms of popularity, Frost&#x2019;s true peers aren&#x2019;t Pound or Stevens or Eliot, but rather figures like Pablo Picasso and Winston Churchill. Frost is not simply that rare bird, a popular poet; he is one of the best-known personages of the past hundred years in any cultural arena. In all of American history, the only writers who can match or surpass him are Mark Twain and Edgar Allan Poe, and the only poet in the history of English-language verse who commands more attention is William Shakespeare.</p><p>This level of recognition makes poetry readers uncomfortable. Poets, we assume, are not popular&#x2014;at least after 1910 or so. If one becomes popular, then either he must be a second-tier talent catering to mass taste (as Sandburg is often thought to be) or there must be some kind of confusion or deception going on. The latter explanation is generally applied to Frost&#x2019;s celebrity. As Robert Lowell once put it, &#x201c;Robert Frost at midnight, the audience gone / to vapor, the great act laid on the shelf in mothballs.&#x201d; The &#x201c;great act&#x201d; is for &#x201c;the audience&#x201d; of ordinary readers, but his true admirers know better. He is really a wolf, we say, and it is only the sheep who are fooled. It&#x2019;s an explanation that Frost himself sometimes encouraged, much as he used to boast about the trickiness of &#x201c;The Road Not Taken&#x201d; in private correspondence.

Conceived, financed, and managed by Yankee capitalists and designed to be a model town, Lawrence was among the earliest planned manufacturing communities in the country and it quickly became the largest woolen and worsted manufacturing center in the world. From the outset, Lawrence was the gateway to America for thousands of immigrants. Here, they found work, acquired skills, learned English, educated their young people, and eventually became citizens. By 1910, almost 90,000 people--representing 25 nationalities and speaking 40 languages--had made their home within the seven square miles that constitute Lawrence. Their unique story is told through images lovingly cherished in velvet photograph albums and old cardboard boxes, and gathered over the decades from the tenement attics and basements of those who actually lived the lives shown in these photographs. The images vividly portray America's industrial and immigrant past, and show the lives, work, aspirations, pleasures, and sometimes the suffering, of the people who created the city of Lawrence.</p><p>This compelling visual history has been created by Eartha Dengler, founder and former director of the Immigrant City Archives; Katherine Khalife, freelance writer and editor; and Ken Skulski, writer and research consultant. Together, they have explored Lawrence&#x2019;s rich heritage and brought to life the people and events, which have shaped this dynamic and diverse city.</p><h2>Michael English 3D Eye: The Posters, prints and paintings of Michael English, 1966-1979</h2><p>Free 2 day shipping by Amazon.

Celebrated by colonial writers, filmed by Hollywood, magnet for Europeans and Moroccans, Casablanca is above all an exceptional collection of urban spaces, houses, and gardens. While it is true that Casablanca developed as a port city well before the introduction of the French in 1907, it unquestionably ranks among the most significant urban creations of the twentieth century, attracting remarkable teams of architects and planners. Their commissions came from clients who were interested in innovation and modernization, thereby fostering the emergence of Casablanca as a laboratory for legislative, technological, and visual experimentation. <br><br> Having studied the city for ten years, Jean-Louis Cohen and Monique Eleb trace, from the late nineteenth century to the early 1960s, the rebirth of a once-forgotten port and its metamorphosis into a teeming metropolis that is an amalgam of Mediterranean culture from Tunisia, Algeria, Spain, and Italy. The extensive presentation of the significant buildings of this hybrid city -- where, alongside the French, Muslim and Jewish Moroccan patrons commissioned provocative buildings -- is drawn from French and Moroccan archives, including hundreds of previously unpublished photographs. Cohen and Eleb focus as much on Casablanca's diverse social fabric as its urban spaces, chronicling the clients, inhabitants, and inventive architects who comprise the human component of an essential yet overlooked episode of modernism.</p><p>Jean-Louis Cohen is an architect and historian. He is a professor at the Institute of Fine Arts at New York University and the director of the Institute Fran�ais d'Architecture.

This catalog to the traveling exhibition of a major portion of the collection provides a visual survey of significant artists from the mid-19th to the late 20th centuries. (The international exhibition will be seen in this country at New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art.) More than 80 color plates show works arranged alphabetically by artist's name, followed by a section of succinct, well-researched artists' biographies. Preceding the plates are six essays related to the collection and the development of African American art. Tritobia Benjamin's introduction; the foreword by Barnwell, a MacArthur Fellow at the Art Institute of Chicago; and Evans's own "Reflections on Collecting" address the significance of the collection and how it came to be; three other scholarly essays focus on specific artists and their roles in art history.

After five years of rejection and one complete revision, Heller's first book,&nbsp;<i>Chickens Aren't the Only Ones</i>, about egg-laying animals, was published in 1981. It was so successful that the sequel, and second book to be published,&nbsp;<i>Animals Born Alive And Well</i>&nbsp;(1982), about mammals, quickly followed. In 1983 and 1984, her third and fourth titles,&nbsp;<i>The Reason For A Flower</i>&nbsp;(about plants that have seeds and flowers) and&nbsp;<i>Plants That Never Ever Bloom</i>&nbsp;(about plants that do not) were published.<br><br>She then began work on a collection of six books, the&nbsp;<i>How To Hide</i>&nbsp;series on camouflage and the magic of this phenomenon in nature, which covered the entire animal kingdom -- insects, birds, mammals, amphibians, reptiles, and sea creatures. The next collection of books became a five-volume series on parts of speech:&nbsp;<i>A Cache of Jewels and Other Collective Nouns; Kites Sail High: A Book About Verbs; Many Luscious Lollipops: A Book About Adjectives; Merry-Go-Round: A Book About Nouns;</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Up, Up and Away: A Book About Adverbs</i>.

Heller says of her work, "All my books are nonfiction picture books in rhyme. I find writing in rhyme enjoyable and challenging, and I think it is an easy way for children to learn new facts and acquire a sophisticated vocabulary. Children are not intimidated by big words. I try to make my writing succinct and allow the illustrations to convey as much information as possible."ea. vol: illus. by author. unpaged. Grosset. Oct. 1985. PSm $4.95.

It was a job of work, and I did it as well as I could, and that was that. But now, you see, it has no necessity except itself. And, of course, it's hard; it's always been hard, and it's getting harder. So when I'm stuck I think, this isn't my livelihood, and it isn't great art, it's only detective stories. You read them and write them for fun." Is this a clue to the mystery of why Dorothy L. Sayers put aside her 13th full-length Lord Peter novel in 1938 and never finished it? She had made lots of money, and was much more interested in translating Dante and writing about religion. Or is it another excellent novelist, Jill Paton Walsh, speculating--in a perfect imitation of Sayers's voice--on what might have happened? Walsh was invited by the estate of Sayers's illegitimate son, Anthony Fleming, to finish <i>Thrones, Dominations</i>. She has done a splendid job, certain to please Sayers loyalists on the "dorothyl" listserv as well as those new to the Wimsey canon. Lord Peter has been made much more human and interesting by marriage; Harriet is a wise and acerbic companion; and the story, about the murders of two beautiful young women involved with a theatrical producer, is full of twists and connivance. There's also a fascinating subplot involving the soon-to-abdicate King Edward VII and a country on the brink of World War II. Earlier Wimseys in paperback include <i>The Five Red Herrings</i>, <i>Gaudy Night</i>, <i>Murder Must Advertise</i>, and <i>Unnatural Death</i>. Books in print by Walsh include a mystery called <i>A Piece of Justice</i> and a novel, <i>The Serpentine Cave</i>.Praise for <i>Thrones, Dominations</i>:<p> "Engrossing, intelligent, and provocative." --<i>The New York Times Book Review</i></p><p> "Extraordinary...it is impossible to tell where Dorothy L.

During the last years of the Cold War, the Soviet Union sent some of its most elite troops to unfamiliar lands in Central Asia to fight a vaguely defined enemy, which eventually defeated their superior numbers with unconventional tactics. Although the Soviet leadership initially saw the invasion as a victory, many Russian soldiers came to view the war as a demoralizing and devastating defeat, the consequences of which had a substantial impact on the Soviet Union and its collapse.</p><p>Feifer's extensive research includes eye-opening interviews with participants from both sides of the conflict. In gripping detail, he vividly depicts the invasion of a volatile country that no power has ever successfully conquered. Parallels between the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and the U.S. invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq are impossible to ignore&#x2014;both conflicts were waged amid vague ideological rhetoric about freedom. Both were roundly condemned by the outside world for trying to impose their favored forms of government on countries with very different ways of life. And both seem destined to end on uncertain terms. </p><p>A groundbreaking account seen through the eyes of the men who fought it, <em>The Great Gamble</em> tells an unforgettable story full of drama, action, and political intrigue whose relevance in our own time is greater than ever.</p><p>Gregory Feifer is the former Moscow correspondent for National Public Radio. He was educated at Harvard University and lives in Prague with his wife, Elizabeth, and son, Sebastian.</p></p><h2>The Complete Corvette Restoration and Technical Guide, Vol. 1: 1953 Through 1962</h2><p>This is a mind-boggling book. For the enthusiast intent upon restoring his Corvette to the look and condition it enjoyed when it left the factory, it is absolutely essential. For the enthusiast desiring to learn everything - every detail, every nuance which made one Corvette different from another, at model-year changeover, at mid-model, early model-year production, late model-year production - it is the ultimate reference book. This is the history of what happened to the Corvette on the assembly line from 1953 to 1962. It is the story of every Corvette that was produced for a decade. Its engine. Its chassis. Its body. From Powerglide to Positraction to Power Team Combinations. From ignition shielding to hose clamps to identification labels. From windshield wipers to door latch controls to taillight assemblies. It&#39;s a bit like a mystery book too, and could almost be recommended to aficionados of that genre regardless of their interest in Corvettes or even cars for that matter. To write this book Noland Adams had to become something of a Sherlock Holmes.</p><p>Solid axle fans rejoice! I can&#x2019;t recommend this book strongly enough for all Corvette owners! -- <i>Frank Kodl, Keepin&#x2019; Track of Vettes</i><br><br>There must be something about solid axle Corvettes that isn&#x2019;t covered, but I haven&#x2019;t found it. -- <i>Richard F.

Three blizzards have blanketed the village in forty inches of snow. Bryce Peck, Mitch's blue-blooded neighbor out on Big Sister Island, has just been found dead of a drug overdose. Young Kylie Champlain has slammed her car head-on into an office building after she's caught trying to shoplift a pair of Ugg boots. And a grinch has taken to stealing the mail from Hank Merrill's postal route, which happens to be the main route through the historic district.</p><p>Stealing the U.S. mail is a serious federal crime, but Des soon discovers that she's onto something much bigger: a black-market prescription drug gang with ties to organized crime. And now a fourth blizzard is on its way. And so is another murder. And, somehow, the man in her life has managed to land himself smack dab in the middle of the whole mess. Not to mention that he's in way over his head with Josie Cantro, the beautiful and treacherous life-coach who just may be responsible for it all. If Des doesn't act fast, this will truly be a Christmas to remember---but for all of the wrong reasons.</p><p>David Handler's<i> The Snow White Christmas Cookie</i>, the ninth book in this original series is brimming with plenty of murder, mayhem, and holiday spirit.</p></p><p><b>David Handler</b><b>'s</b> first book in the Berger and Mitry series, <i>The Cold Blue Blood</i><i>,</i> was a Dilys Award finalist and BookSense Top Ten pick.

Especially if enough snow had fallen for it to qualify as a genuine white Christmas. And this December had delivered an epic amount of snow. Three monster blizzards had already blanketed the village in forty inches of the white stuff, and Christmas day was still a whole week away. The gem of Connecticut&#x2019;s Gold Coast had been transformed into an idyllic winter wonderland, one part theme park, two parts Currier and Ives print. Giggling kids were riding their sleds right down the middle of Dorset Street. Families were out building giant snowmen in their front yards. Red-cheeked carolers went from door to door spreading Yuletide cheer as the eggnog flowed at house parties throughout the village. Horse-drawn sleighs took giddy revelers to and fro. Candles burned in the windows of the Historic District&#x2019;s colonial mansions to welcome them. <br>Yet another nor&#x2019;easter was due to blow in by tomorrow morning. But tonight was frosty and clear, with a bright half-moon and stars twinkling in the sky. And so they strolled, swaddled in their winter coats, scarves and hats. Des Mitry, the Connecticut state resident trooper, a lithe, long-limbed, six-feet-one-inch woman of color. And Mitch Berger, the weight-challenged Jewish film critic from New York City whose only experience with violence before he&#x2019;d met Des had consisted of the films of Mr. Sam Peckinpah. <br>&#x201c;Well, I just may have to mention it a ninth time,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m still in a state of awe.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Mitch, I&#x2019;m just wearing my new jeans.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Your new <i>skinny</i> jeans. Do you have any idea how spectacular a double-bill this is&#x2014;your booty and a pair of skinny jeans? Hell, you&#x2019;re lucky I don&#x2019;t throw you down in that snow bank over there.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Yeah, good luck with that, wild man.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you know what a hottie you are?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I know I&#x2019;ve never worn pants this tight in my life. They feel like dark-washed Saran Wrap. Are you sure they don&#x2019;t make me look like a skanky teenager?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Yeah,&#x201d; he said dreamily. <br>&#x201c;Yeah <i>what</i>?&#x201d; She came to a halt, shoving her heavy horn-rimmed glasses up her nose. &#x201c;You&#x2019;d tell me straight up if I looked silly, right?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Of course. But how can you even think that?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Because I&#x2019;m not fifteen years old anymore.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;And I for one am glad. If you were we&#x2019;d have zero to talk about plus I&#x2019;d be a felon and&nbsp;&#x2026; hold on a sec, you&#x2019;ve got something on your face.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;What is it?&#x201d; <br>He took her in his arms and kissed her. &#x201c;Just me.&#x201d; <br>She touched his beaming face with her fingers. Never before had a man made her feel this happy. &#x201c;Doughboy, are you <i>ever</i> going to act your age?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I wouldn&#x2019;t count on it.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Good.&#x201d; <br>They were on their way to an eggnog party at old Rut Peck&#x2019;s house. Rut had served as Dorset&#x2019;s postmaster for thirty-seven years and seemed to be related to everybody in town. He definitely knew everybody. And he&#x2019;d lived across from the firehouse in the same upended shoebox of a farmhouse on the corner of Dorset Street and Maple Lane ever since he was born. Until last summer, that is, when the eighty-two-year-old widower got lost driving to his dentist across the Connecticut River in Old Saybrook. When the police stopped him for running a red light two hours later he was sixty miles away in Bridgeport and not sure how he&#x2019;d gotten there. A small stroke, his doctor determined. Rut wasn&#x2019;t allowed to drive after that. Nor did it seem like a good idea for him to be living alone. His cousins, Marge and Mary Jewett, the no-nonsense fifty-something sisters who ran Dorset&#x2019;s volunteer ambulance service, had moved him into a unit at Essex Meadows, an assisted-living facility, and put his house on the market. But because of the Great Recession he still hadn&#x2019;t gotten a single decent offer. When Marge and Mary asked the old postmaster what he wanted for Christmas this year, he told them he wanted to come home for an old-time eggnog party. And so they&#x2019;d obliged him. His cleaning lady, Tina Champlain, who continued to keep the place tidy for prospective buyers, had set up a tree in the parlor and decorated it. There was a wreath on the front door and electric candles in every window. Tina&#x2019;s husband, Lem, had cleared all of the snow from the driveway and front walk. <br>Rut was waiting right there at the door to greet them, happy to be home again with so many friends. He was a short, stocky old fellow with tufty white hair and a nose that looked remarkably like a potato. His eyes were an impish blue behind his thick black-framed glasses. He wore hearing aids in both ears and a big red Christmas sweater that one of his many widowed lady friends must have knitted for him. <br>Inside, the parlor smelled of nutmeg and fresh spruce. A fire crackled in the potbellied wood stove. Dozens of bright-eyed people were chattering excitedly as they sipped eggnog and nibbled at the high-cholesterol circa-1957 hors d&#x2019;oevres that Dorseteers seemed to love. Mitch could not get enough of them. After he&#x2019;d shed his coat he headed right for them, salivating with fat-boy delight over the array of deviled eggs, cocktail weenies, and chicken livers wrapped in bacon. There was an entire sliced ham, cheeses, a basket of bread and rolls. There was wine and assorted soft drinks to go along with the eggnog which, judging by the decibel level of the revelers, was spiked with bourbon but good. <br>Rut was one of those rare people whose friendships cut across Dorset&#x2019;s class lines. Bob Paffin, the blue-blooded first selectman, was standing right there sipping eggnog alongside a full-blooded Swamp Yankee like Paulette Zander, Dorset&#x2019;s current postmaster, whose father, Gary, had maintained the village&#x2019;s septic tanks. Paulette was there with her live-in boyfriend, Hank Merrill, who was a postal carrier as well as assistant chief of Dorset&#x2019;s volunteer fire department. Actually, it looked as if half of the fire department was there. <br>Des was also happy to spot Bella Tillis, who until very recently had been her housemate and now lived practically next door to Rut&#x2019;s place at the Captain Chadwick House, the Historic District&#x2019;s choicest condominium colony. She&#x2019;d moved in two weeks ago along with three of the six feral kittens she and Des had rescued from behind Laysville Hardware. Bella, a feisty seventy-eight-year-old bowling ball of a Jewish grandmother from Brooklyn, was Des&#x2019;s next door neighbor in Woodbridge when Des&#x2019;s ex-husband, Brandon, had dumped her for another woman. Des wouldn&#x2019;t have survived without Bella. And part of her missed having Bella around. Although it was awfully nice to have the bungalow overlooking Uncas Lake to herself again. Des&#x2019;s studio was spread out all over the living room. Her heart-wrenching drawings of the murder victims she&#x2019;d encountered were tacked up here, there, everywhere. She drew them in the early light of dawn, deconstructing the haunting memories line by line, shadow by shadow. It was how she dealt. <br>&#x201c;How are you, girl?&#x201d; Des asked, hugging Bella warmly. <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve been groped by three different old coots already. I don&#x2019;t know if it&#x2019;s the eggnog or what. I do know that not one of them can finish what they started. But enough about me. Those jeans you&#x2019;re wearing&#x2026;&#x201d; Bella eyed her up and down. &#x201c;Are they new?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Why are you asking?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Because they make you look like a runway model, that&#x2019;s why.&#x201d; Bella glanced over at Mitch, who was shoving a deviled egg into his pie hole as he stood chatting with Lew the Plumber. &#x201c;Does that man know how lucky he is?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I try to remind him from time to time.&#x201d; Des reached over and squeezed her hand. &#x201c;I miss you, Bella.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Tie that bull outside, as we used to say on Nostrand Avenue. You two need the house to yourselves. Now you can cavort around naked whenever, wherever you feel like it.&#x201d; <br>Des smiled at her. &#x201c;And, God knows, we cavort a lot.&#x201d; Usually, two or three nights a week at Mitch&#x2019;s antique caretaker&#x2019;s cottage out on Big Sister Island. And another two nights a week at her place. They had no particular schedule. They were comfortable with where they were. Or weren&#x2019;t&#x2014;which was ready to live together full time. Plus he had to be in New York a lot for screenings and still had his apartment there. It wasn&#x2019;t a conventional arrangement, but nothing about them was conventional. <br>Tina Champlain came over to them toting platters of deviled eggs and cocktail weenies. <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re Rut&#x2019;s guest tonight,&#x201d; Des reminded her. &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t have to serve.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Yeah, I do,&#x201d; Tina responded. &#x201c;If I don&#x2019;t, your boy will eat all of them.&#x201d; <br>It wasn&#x2019;t just Mitch. Deviled eggs and cocktail weenies were catnip to the male of the species. Tina&#x2019;s husband, Lem, was already hovering close to her. <br>Tina and Lem made for one of Dorset&#x2019;s odder couples. She was a tiny, high-strung Chihuahua of a woman in her thirties with frizzy black hair and slightly protruding dark eyes. Nice little figure, although she hid it underneath a baggy fleece top and loose-fitting jeans. Lem was a gruff bear who reveled in looking menacing. It was how he got a measure of respect from the blue bloods. The man was not only mammoth but he shaved his head and wore a ZZ Top beard halfway down his chest. He also carried a large knife in a sheath on his belt, just in case he needed a blade at an eggnog party. Lem owned Champlain Landscaping. During the warm months he and his crew of mow boys tended the lawns in Dorset. This time of year they plowed driveways and delivered firewood. Between Lem&#x2019;s business and the money Tina made cleaning houses, they made out pretty well for a couple of teen sweethearts who&#x2019;d barely finished high school. Tina was already pregnant with their daughter, Kylie, by then. Kylie was eighteen now and when you saw her and Tina around town together you&#x2019;d swear they were sisters. Kylie was tiny like she was. <br>&#x201c;How&#x2019;s Kylie doing?&#x201d; Des asked them. <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t get me started,&#x201d; Lem growled. <br>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s fine,&#x201d; Tina said, shooting a look at him&#x2014;and then at Mitch, who had inched his way over by her side. &#x201c;No more weenies for you.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Does that mean I can have a deviled egg?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;One,&#x201d; she allowed. <br>&#x201c;I love you, Tina,&#x201d; Mitch said, popping it into his mouth. <br>&#x201c;Kylie&#x2019;s <i>not</i> fine,&#x201d; Lem muttered at her. <br>&#x201c;We want her to go to nursing school,&#x201d; Tina said with a weary sigh. &#x201c;All she wants to do is party and shop.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;That girl can&#x2019;t be trusted with a credit card,&#x201d; Lem said. &#x201c;I had to take hers away and tear &#x2019;em up.&#x201d; <br>Tina&#x2019;s cell phone vibrated in the pocket of her fleece top. &#x201c;Hold these for a sec, will you, Lemmy?&#x201d; <br>He took the platters from her so she could read the text message on her phone&#x2019;s screen. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re as bad as Kylie,&#x201d; he complained as she thumbed out a response. &#x201c;On that damned thing every second.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s my <i>mom,</i> will ya? She moved in with her cousin in Philly last month,&#x201d; Tina explained, her eyes never leaving the screen. &#x201c;And now she texts me a hundred times a day. There, all done, okay?&#x201d; She tucked the phone back in her pocket and took the platters back from him. &#x201c;What were we talking about?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Kylie.&#x201d; Des couldn&#x2019;t help notice the chippy vibe Tina and Lem gave off. &#x201c;Is she seeing anyone special these days?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s been spending a little time with Pat Faulstich,&#x201d; Lem replied. <br>&#x201c;Well, <i>that</i> won&#x2019;t last,&#x201d; Tina assured him. &#x201c;I <i>don&#x2019;t</i> want her mixed up with one of your plow monkeys.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Pat&#x2019;s a good kid. He works hard.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s a no-good cheesehead.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Hey, I have a great idea,&#x201d; Hank Merrill put in as he snatched a cocktail weenie from Tina&#x2019;s platter. &#x201c;Why don&#x2019;t we fix her up with Casey?&#x201d; <br>Lem let out a huge laugh. &#x201c;Brilliant idea.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Isn&#x2019;t it? What do you think, hon?&#x201d; Hank asked Paulette as she joined them. &#x201c;Kylie Champlain and your bouncing baby boy?&#x201d; <br>Dorset&#x2019;s postmaster considered her response carefully before she said, &#x201c;I think that you&#x2019;d better slow down on that eggnog. And don&#x2019;t be nasty.&#x201d; Paulette was Hank&#x2019;s boss, if anyone cared to get technical. She&#x2019;d gone to work as a carrier for Rut Peck back when she was in her twenties. She was in her early fifties now. A tall, taut, good-looking woman with a strong jaw and long, beautiful black hair streaked with silver. Also a tight-lipped, controlled woman who seemed to be under a great deal of strain. Worry lines furrowed her brow. Casey was her twenty-eight-year-old son from a marriage that had ended in divorce long ago. Paulette had wangled him a part-time job as a weekend carrier. He lived in the basement of the house she shared with Hank. <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not being nasty,&#x201d; insisted Hank, who was evidently well into the high-octane eggnog. &#x201c;Just saying Casey and Kylie would make a nice couple. Am I right or am I right?&#x201d; he asked Lem. <br>&#x201c;Totally right,&#x201d; Lem assured him with a big grin. <br>Lem liked Hank. Everyone liked Hank. He was a goofy, amiable and extremely active fellow around Dorset. In addition to his duties on the fire department, he coached the girls&#x2019; high school basketball team and played tuba in the Dorset town band. Most Saturdays, he could be found working the second chair for John the Barber. Hank was lanky and splay footed with thinning sandy-colored hair and an extremely large, busy Adam&#x2019;s apple. He had the wheezy laugh of a longtime smoker. He also had a habit of sucking on his teeth, which were crooked and rather horsy. <br>&#x201c;Casey <i>ought</i> to find himself a nice girl,&#x201d; Hank went on, pausing to take another gulp of his eggnog. &#x201c;Not to mention a full-time job and his own place to live. He spends all day in our basement stuffing his face and watching TV. And all night at the Rustic drinking beer and watching TV. That kid must spend eighteen hours a day in front of the TV.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Sounds good to me,&#x201d; Mitch said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d take that deal.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;So would I,&#x201d; Hank agreed. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d like to know how he got so lucky.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Casey has issues,&#x201d; Paulette said to him in a distinctly cool voice. <br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s not the only one,&#x201d; Bella interjected, wagging a stubby finger at Hank. &#x201c;I have an issue with <i>you.</i> I have gotten no mail for the past two days, mister. Not so much as a single Chanukah card. And I still haven&#x2019;t received my three-month supply of Lipitor. My online pharmacy mailed it to me from Dayton, Ohio, ten days ago.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s the snow, Mrs. Tillis,&#x201d; Paulette explained. &#x201c;Our out-of-state-mail isn&#x2019;t coming in at Bradley Airport because the planes can&#x2019;t land. And our trucks can&#x2019;t make it here from Norwich because the governor keeps closing the highways.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;That part I understand.&#x201d; Bella turned her piercing gaze back at Hank. &#x201c;But how come you didn&#x2019;t say one word about the marble cake I left in my box for you? I baked it for you special.&#x201d; <br>Hank&#x2019;s mouth opened but no sound came out. He looked totally thrown. <br>Paulette stepped into the awkward silence. &#x201c;Lem, all of this snow must be good for <i>your</i> business.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;d think so,&#x201d; he acknowledged, scratching at his beard with a thumbnail the size of a clamshell. It wasn&#x2019;t a very clean-looking thumbnail. It wasn&#x2019;t a very clean-looking beard either. &#x201c;Only, I&#x2019;ve been working harder than I ever have, plowing day and night, and I&#x2019;m practically going broke. They keep jacking up the price of road salt for one thing. And, well, this is Dorset. People don&#x2019;t pay their bills.&#x201d; He glanced over in the direction of First Selectman Paffin. &#x201c;Especially the rich ones. Keep telling me they left my money out in their mailbox. Except, guess what? The money&#x2019;s not there.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;How...</p><h2>Regiment of Women</h2><p>Once again, Thomas Berger brings a satiric and irreverent perspective to the human experience, evoking a world that most dare not even imagine and effectively dismantling all existing definitions of sex and gender. &#34;Imagined with such ferocity and glee that we assent to it almost in spite of ourselves . . . a brilliant accomplishment by one of out best novelists.&#34;--New York Times Book Review.</p><p></p><h2>Amazing Spider-Man: The Saga of the Alien Costume (Marvel Comics)</h2><p>It all began on Battleworld, where the Amazing Spiderman&#39;s world-famous red-and-blue costume was destroyed while he was fighting in the Secret Wars.

Hardcover Reprint.</p><p>Jenny Colter, emotionally and physically scarred by the savage destruction of her family and home in Georgia, plans to start over as a schoolmistress in post-Civil War Missouri. En route, her train is robbed by outlaw Luke Morgan, who happens to be a folk hero in her new hometown. An unconvincing attraction develops between the respectable schoolmistress and the renegade; they marry, and with Jenny's help Luke predictably turns from crime to a political career. By defining the two-dimensional characters through narrative rather than action, best-selling author Brandewyne ( The Outlaw Hearts , Warner, 1988) fails to involve her readers' emotions. She uses Missouri history only incidentally, and her meticulous reproduction of slave dialect not only disrupts the narrative flow but appears condescending, weakening a potentially strong secondary love story between Jenny's servants.

It is 2025 and the planet is rapidly approaching environmental death. Dr. Gupta Singh, a Hindu guru with a Jim Jones-like following, has proposed the suicide, by lottery, of one-third of the world's population. His followers have elected a Depopulationist majority in Congress. Led by journalist John Sinclair, a small group hopes to prove that Singh is a fraud. Singh is a formidable enemy: he cancels the medical-cosmetological treatment that the 72-year-old Sinclair (who looks 46 due to the treatment) receives, causing Sinclair to age rapidly. Singh sets the feared tax police after Sinclair, alters his records, and wipes out his wealth. Tension mounts as Sinclair stalks Singh and gains access to his "conviction"an electronic document into Singh's true identity and character. While this is less straightforward and slower to start than Warday, it is just as sobering in its tragic possibilities. Diana Hirsch, PGCMLS, Md.<br>Copyright 1986 Reed Business Information, Inc.The authors of the best seller Warday ( LJ 4/1/84) depict in powerful detail a 21st-century Earth with devastated environment and rampant overpopulation. A rich and comfortable elite coexists with malnourished, pitiful billions, "the victim generation." The rich enjoy youth preservation treatments and other biomedical wonders while the rest just endure the toxicity and pollution. Hero John Sinclair and a few rich companies fight to thwart the leader of a burgeoning Depopulation Movement that would have each third person poisoned to "solve" the population crisis. Readers will follow with grim fascination these struggles to survive in a dying world. Sobering message eclipses story, and the book should strike home with a variety of informed citizens.

Yet only 52 days after the gruesome triple-murder was discovered, frustrated authorities suspended the case indefinitely. <br><br>Patrol Sergeant Truman Simons, who had been called to the scene that night, saw the carnage first-hand -- and vowed to find the ferocious killer or killers. He soon became a man with a mission, risking his career and his family's safety in search of evidence. Plunging himself into a netherworld of violence and evil, Simons finally got close enough to a murderous ringleader to hear his careless whispers--and ultimately, put him and his three accomplices behind bars for the brutal slayings.<br><br>Now, in his Edgar Award-winning account of the Lake Waco killings, acclaimed true crime writer Carlton Stowers lays bare the facts behind the tragic crimes, the twisted predators, and the heroic man who broke the investigation--with important updated information based on new developments in the case.<br></p><p>The three teenagers found in a wooded Texas park suffered slow torture with a knife before dying. A usually implacable cop who arrived early on the scene, Truman Simons, was so shaken by the lonely, abandoned appearance of their naked bodies that he got down on his knees next to one of the girls and promised he would find her killer. But he wasn't part of the initial investigation, which exhausted all leads and was labeled "inactive" after just 52 days. Simons begged his superior to be allowed to investigate on his own, slowly tracked down a few pieces of the puzzle, then was asked to drop the case after a suspect he'd arrested was set free. He then did what few cops would do: he quit the police department, took a job as a jailer, and pursued the case on his free time, eventually forming an oddly intimate jailer-suspect relationship with one of the killers. <i>Careless Whispers</i> won the 1987 Edgar Award for best fact crime.</p><h2>P.S.

Reprint.</p><p>Anyone who's ever wished that the charlatans of the New Age movement would get their comeuppance from a real and potent Evil, will enjoy this well-crafted horror novel. From his wicked characterization of a cynical ad-copy writer who turns to writing occult books to make a buck, to his portrayal of the moral uncertainty of the followers who blindly hunger for occult knowledge, to his evocation of scary monsters (described as "astral jellyfish," "ghostly buzzsaws," and "wheels of grainy flame") from the killing fields of Cambodia, Marc Laidlaw knows how to hit the high points. As a monsters vs. humans story, the novel's plot is a bit unsatisfying (dramatic endings are hard to pull off), but as Brian Stableford writes in <i>Necrofile,</i> "the strength of <i>The 37th Mandala</i> ... lies in its painstaking attempt to scrutinize and analyze the psychological malaise which lies at the heart of the so-called New Age."Attempts to achieve a genuine sense of awe are rare in contemporary horror. So Laidlaw (The Orchid Eater) is to be complimented for making the effort in his new novel, even though it falls short of its visionary ambitions. The titular mandalas, clearly influenced by Lovecraft, are both extradimensional "organisms" and symbolic "archetypes of decay" that manifest in our world as 37 distinct designs. When New Age hack writer Derek Crowe pilfers the manuscript in which they appear and rewrites it as a book of bromides for the crystal-gazing crowd, he inadvertently creates a cult of believers that attracts the evil entities from across the terrestrial threshold. Crowe's struggle to deal with what he has wrought brings him into contact with a wildly varied cast of characters, including a woman who becomes a physical embodiment of the worst mandala and a Cambodian refugee who seeks to control the mandalas for his own purposes. Describing the unspeakable is a daunting task, but Laidlaw rises to it, creating a manifestation of the unearthly that is both accessible and impenetrably alien. Yet the novel's cosmic scope never quite comes to life, as the sense of menace generated by the mandalas remains embedded in the individual dramas of the novel's characters. The result is a superior tale of human beings in thrall to occult forces, but one whose reach exceeds its grasp. <br>Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Tangram Puzzles: 500 Tricky Shapes to Confound &amp; Astound/ Includes Deluxe Wood Tangrams</h2><p>It's endless fun!

Focusing on the lives and work of black writers, visual artists, musicians, and filmmakers, Daniel Widener tells how black cultural politics changed over time, and how altered political realities generated new forms of artistic and cultural expression. His narrative is filled with figures invested in the politics of black art and culture in postwar Los Angeles, including not only African American artists but also black nationalists, affluent liberal whites, elected officials, and federal bureaucrats. <p></p><p>Along with the politicization of black culture, Widener explores the rise of a distinctive regional Black Arts Movement. Originating in the efforts of wartime cultural activists, the movement was rooted in the black working class and characterized by struggles for artistic autonomy and improved living and working conditions for local black artists. As new ideas concerning art, racial identity, and the institutional position of African American artists emerged, dozens of new collectives appeared, from the Watts Writers Workshop, to the Inner City Cultural Center, to the New Art Jazz Ensemble. Spread across generations of artists, the Black Arts Movement in Southern California was more than the artistic affiliate of the local civil-rights or black-power efforts: it was a social movement itself. Illuminating the fundamental connections between expressive culture and political struggle, <i>Black Arts West</i> is a major contribution to the histories of Los Angeles, black radicalism, and avant-garde art.</p></p><p>""Black Arts West" knocked my socks off. Daniel Widener's exciting account of the 'Watts Renaissance' fundamentally revises our picture of contemporary L.A. art and literary scenes, and adds a crucial new chapter to the history of Black cultural radicalism during the 1960s and 1970s."--Mike Davis, author of "City of Quartz: Excavating the Future in Los Angeles<br>"<p>Daniel Widener is Associate Professor of History at the University of California, San Diego.</p></p><h2>Arborsculpture: Solutions for a Small Planet</h2><p>Such a cool book on Arborsculpture!

Royalty, celebrities, diplomats, fleeing troops, and ordinary citizens desperately slogged their way across France and Spain to reach the neutral nation. Here the exiles found peace and plenty, though they often faced excruciating delays and uncertainties before they could book passage on ships or planes to their final destinations. As well as offering freedom from war, Lisbon provided spies, smugglers, relief workers, military figures, and adventurers with an avenue into the conflict and its opportunities. Ronald Weber traces the engaging stories of many of these colorful transients as they took pleasure in the city's charm and benign climate, its ample food and drink, its gambling casino and Atlantic beaches. Yet an ever-present shadow behind the gaiety was the fragile nature of Portuguese neutrality, which at any moment the Axis or Allies might choose to end.</p><p><b>Ronald Weber</b> is professor emeritus of American studies at the University of Notre Dame. His past books include <i>News of Paris</i>, <i>America in Change</i>, <i>The Literature of Fact</i>, and <i>Hired Pens</i>. He lives in Valparaiso, Indiana.A leisurely, story-filled account of life in Nazi-occupied Europe's last open door to freedom. During World War II, the port city of Lisbon, in neutral Portugal, was the destination for a flood of refugees fleeing the Nazi terror who hoped to make their way to the United States and elsewhere. An estimated 100,000 or more refugees passed through the old-fashioned European capital, writes Weber (American Studies/Univ. of Notre Dame; <i>News of Paris: American Journalists in the City of Light Between the Wars</i>, 2006, etc.), often waiting for weeks or months for a place on a freighter, fishing boat or plane. At the same time, reporters, diplomats, spies, military leaders and others shuttled in and out freely, and the formerly sleepy city became a frenzied bazaar, charged with energy, conspiratorial feeling and moral uncertainty. . . . Based on newspaper accounts as well as diaries and letters, Weber's book brings the wartime city to life, tracing the machinations of agents and double agents in bars and hotels; Varian Fry's work on behalf of the International Rescue Committee to find safe passage for artists and intellectuals; and secret meetings where belligerents exchanged information. With the war's end, Prime Minister Antonio Salazar's authoritarian government began promoting the country as a postwar tourist destination. An engaging . . . chronicle of a city that was 'a way into Europe as well as a way out.' (<i>Kirkus</i>)<br><br>During WWII, people hoping to escape Nazi-occupied Europe made their way to a city that was a gateway to the free world. Lisbon, Portugal, was an open city, politically neutral, which made it a prime destination for refugees. But getting there wasn&#x2019;t easy, and getting out of Lisbon wasn&#x2019;t a walk in the park, either. Weber explores the importance of the Lisbon route to freedom by focusing on the stories of men and women who used it, or who made it possible, people like Arthur Koestler, the Jewish writer who decided to get out of occupied Paris in 1940 (which he did by taking an unusual first step&#x2014;enlisting in the French Foreign Legion); American journalist Varian Fry, who secretly worked for the Emergency Rescue Committee, helping refugees get out of Europe; and Russian-born German spy Lily Sergeyev, who operated as a double agent for the British in Lisbon. . . . The information is educational and very interesting. WWII buffs should definitely give it a read. (<i>Booklist</i>)<br><br>As Weber notes, the Lisbon route is largely forgotten as anything more than Ilsa's destination in Casablanca. But the route offered thousands of refugees a path from Nazi-held Europe to neutral Portugal and from there to America. Weber, professor emeritus of American studies at Notre Dame (<i>News of Paris</i>), assembles vignettes into each stand-alone chapter, creating contrast between the breathless escape of pilots such as Chuck Yeager (who crossed the Pyrenees with the help of the Resistance after his plane was downed in France) and easier journeys by Man Ray, Virgil Thomson (who arrived by train), and the duke and duchess of Windsor, (they fled France by car with a diplomatic escort). As the primary city offering air and sea passage to England and the United States, once quiet Lisbon attracted a mixture of wealthy expatriates, desperate intellectuals, and other refugees, along with spies, creating a colorful collage of luxury hotels, and brothels whose prostitutes were paid to spy; Ian Fleming came as a member of British naval intelligence. Weber provides a rich if sober microcosm of one segment of WWII's substantial displaced population.

She ran away with poet Percy Bysshe Shelley when she was 16 and wrote <i>Frankenstein</i> when she was 19. Three of her four children died in infancy; her husband drowned before she turned 25. Yet Mary Shelley (1797-1851) persevered to write other novels (none so famous as her first), to nurture her husband's literary status (decidedly shaky at the time of his death), and to support her son and acquire a devoted daughter-in-law who was partly responsible for her rather dull posthumous reputation as the quintessential devoted widow. British novelist and biographer Miranda Seymour paints a more nuanced portrait of Mary as a sharply intelligent, sometimes cantankerous woman who did not always graciously suffer Percy's blithe impetuousness and principled infidelities (possibly including one with her stepsister). Guilt at being the innocent cause of her mother's death may have played a part in the genesis of <i>Frankenstein</i>, Seymour acknowledges, but so did Mary's views on slavery, the landscape of Scotland, and the tales she heard there as a teenager of disastrous Arctic expeditions. The story of how <i>Frankenstein</i> came to be written while the Shelleys were vacationing in Switzerland with Byron is well known, but Seymour retells it well. Her strong account of how Mary's character was formed in conflict, first with an unloved stepmother and then with a difficult husband, makes the subsequent 30 years of her life more understandable and almost as interesting as the first quarter century. Drawing on feminist scholarship of the last 30 years but written for the general public, Seymour's lucid biography captures the whole woman, not just the author of <i>Frankenstein</i> or the grieving widow of Percy Shelley. <i>--Wendy Smith</i>Miranda Seymour is a celebrated biographer and novelist, is a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature and a Visiting Professor of English Studies at the University of Nottingham Trent.

With contributors both distinguished and obscure, the journal joined advanced contemporary work and antique folk art. Despite financial problems and politicking between associates, the publication was an enormous success. Unfortunately, the coming of World War I squelched the planning of the next edition, and the first <i>The Blue Rider</i> remained the last. Even so, <i>The Blue Rider</i> and the artists who created it made a lasting impression on art and art journals that followed it.Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: French</p><h2>Bradford Washburn: A Life of Exploration</h2><p>From Denali to Mt.

These paper copies sometimes are all that remain of original works that have become illegible through erosion, or that have been destroyed by war or development, or have been rendered inaccessible through events such as flooding resulting from dam construction. Chinese rubbing techniques are used throughout East Asia to create copies that often also are prized in themselves as works of art. Despite the primary importance of this technology to history, art, archaeology, printing, and many other fields of knowledge, <i>Black Tigers</i> is the first comprehensive study of rubbings in a Western language, and as such will be welcomed by both scholars and collectors.<br><br>In <i>Black Tigers</i>, Kenneth Starr recounts what he has seen and learned in fifty years of fascination with rubbings and travels to China in search of the early inscriptions from which they came.

Now readers of English, with the author as their affable guide, can gain rich insight into a rigorous discipline of classical scholarship, the way in which traditional scholars viewed their world, and some of the exquisite subtleties of Chinese high culture and connoisseurship.<br><br><i>Black Tigers</i> will be an essential resource for students of Chinese art, history, calligraphy, archaeology, and the history of printing.</p><p><p>The frist comprehensive study in a Western language of Chinese ink rubbings of inscriptions and pictorian images, long considered an art in themselves.</p>"An extraordinary work, brimming with essential information available nowhere else about one of the characteristic products of Chinese civilization - the ink rubbing.

Harrist Jr., Columbia University <p> "There is no comparable history of ink rubbings in any Western language. Starr truly has the 'organic feel' for his subject, having made and studied ink rubbings for decades. His knowledge is encyclopedic, and he describes materials and processes with graceful familiarity and clarity.

Haruki Murakami's passion for music runs deep. Before turning his hand to writing, he ran a jazz club in Tokyo, and from The Beatles' "Norwegian Wood" to Franz Liszt's "Years of Pilgrimage," the aesthetic and emotional power of music permeates every one of his much-loved books. Now, in Absolutely on Music, Murakami fulfills a personal dream, sitting down with his friend, acclaimed conductor Seiji Ozawa, to talk, over a period of two years, about their shared interest. Transcribed from lengthy conversations about the nature of music and writing, here they discuss everything from Brahms to Beethoven, from Leonard Bernstein to Glenn Gould, from record collecting to pop-up orchestras, and much more. Ultimately this book gives readers an unprecedented glimpse into the minds of the two maestros.It is essential reading for book and music lovers everywhere.<br></p><p>Haruki Murakami (Author) In 1978, Haruki Murakami was 29 and running a jazz bar in downtown Tokyo. One April day, the impulse to write a novel came to him suddenly while watching a baseball game. That first novel, Hear the Wind Sing, won a new writers&#39; award and was published the following year. More followed, including A Wild Sheep Chase and Hard-Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World, but it was Norwegian Wood, published in 1987, which turned Murakami from a writer into a phenomenon. His books became bestsellers, were translated into many languages, including English, and the door was thrown wide open to Murakami&#39;s unique and addictive fictional universe. Murakami writes with admirable discipline, producing ten pages a day, after which he runs ten kilometres (he began long-distance running in 1982 and has participated in numerous marathons and races), works on translations, and then reads, listens to records and cooks. His passions colour his non-fiction output, from What I Talk About When I Talk About Running to Absolutely On Music, and they also seep into his novels and short stories, providing quotidian moments in his otherwise freewheeling flights of imaginative inquiry. In works such as The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle, 1Q84 and Men Without Women, his distinctive blend of the mysterious and the everyday, of melancholy and humour, continues to enchant readers, ensuring Murakami&#39;s place as one of the world&#39;s most acclaimed and well-loved writers.Seiji Ozawa (Author) Seiji Ozawa served as music director of the Boston Symphony Orchestra for twenty-nine years, and was music director of the Toronto Symphony Orchestra, the San Francisco Symphony, the Chicago Symphony Orchestra&#39;s Ravinia Festival, and Wiener Staatsoper. With Kazuyoshi Akiyama, he formed the Saito Kinen Orchestra and is the director of the Seiji Ozawa Matsumoto Festival. Ozawa has been deeply involved in musical education through his work with Tanglewood Music Center Orchestra, the Ozawa International Chamber Music Academy Okushiga, Seiji Ozawa International Academy Switzerland and as founder of the Seiji Ozawa Music Academy Opera Project, organizations which provide opportunities to outstanding students in Asia and Europe. Among his many honours, Ozawa has been awarded the Officier de la Legion d&#39;Honneur in France, the Japanese Order of Culture, the Kennedy Center Honors, and a Grammy Award for Best Opera Recording.Introduction <br> My Afternoons with Seiji Ozawa<br> &nbsp;<br> Until we started the interviews in this book, I had never had a serious conversation with Seiji Ozawa about music. True, I lived in Boston from 1993 to 1995, while he was still music director of the Boston Symphony Orchestra, and I would often go to concerts he conducted, but I was just another anonymous fan in the audience. Not long after that, my wife and I happened to become friends with his daughter, Seira, and we would see and talk to her father now and then. But our acquaintance was casual and had nothing to do with either his work or mine. <br> &nbsp;<br> Perhaps one reason we never talked seriously about music until recently is that the maestro&#x2019;s work kept him so fully involved. As a result, whenever we got together to have a drink, we&#x2019;d talk about anything other than music. At most, we might have shared a few fragmentary remarks on some musical topics that never led anywhere. Ozawa is the type of person who focuses all his energy on his work, so that when he steps away from it, he needs to take a breather. Knowing this, I avoided bringing up musical topics when I was in his company.<br> &nbsp;<br> In December of 2009, however, Ozawa was found to have esophageal cancer, and after major surgery the following month, he had to restrict his musical activities, largely replacing them with a challenging program of recuperation and rehabilitation. Perhaps because of this regime, we gradually began to talk more about music whenever we met. As weakened as he was, he took on a new vitality whenever the topic turned to music. Even when talking with a musical layman such as myself, any sort of conversation about music seemed to provide the refreshment he needed. And the very fact that I was <i>not</i> in his field probably set him at ease.<br> &nbsp;<br> I have been a fervent jazz fan for close to half a century, but I have also been listening to classical music with no less enjoyment, collecting classical records since I was in high school, and going to concerts as often as time would permit. Especially when I was living in Europe&#x2014; from 1986 to 1989&#x2014;I was immersed in classical music. Listening to jazz and the classics has always been both an effective stimulus and a source of peace to my heart and mind. If someone told me that I could listen to only one or the other but not to both, my life would be immeasurably diminished. As Duke Ellington once said, &#x201c;There are simply two kinds of music, good music and the other kind.&#x201d; In that sense, jazz and classical music are fundamentally the same. The pure joy one experiences listening to &#x201c;good&#x201d; music transcends questions of genre. <br> &nbsp;<br> During one of Seiji Ozawa&#x2019;s visits to my home, we were listening to music and talking about one thing or another when he told me a tremendously interesting story about Glenn Gould and Leonard Bernstein&#x2019;s 1962 performance in New York of Brahms&#x2019;s First Piano Concerto. &#x201c;What a shame it would be to let such a fascinating story just evaporate,&#x201d; I thought. &#x201c;Somebody ought to record it and put it on paper.&#x201d; And, brazen as it may seem, the only &#x201c;somebody&#x201d; that happened to cross my mind at the moment was <i>me</i>. <br> &nbsp;<br> When I suggested this to Seiji Ozawa, he liked the idea immediately. &#x201c;Why not?&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got plenty of time to spare these days. Let&#x2019;s do it.&#x201d; To have Seiji Ozawa ill with cancer was a heart-wrenching development for the music world, for me personally, and of course for him; but that it gave rise to this time for the two of us to sit and have good, long talks about music may be one of those rare silver linings that are not in fact to be found in every cloud.<br> &nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;<br> As much as I have loved music over the years, I never received a formal musical education, have virtually no technical knowledge of the field, and am a complete layman where most things musical are concerned. During our conversations, some of my comments may have been amateurish or even insulting, but Ozawa is not the sort of person to let such things bother him. He gave each remark serious thought and responded to each question, for which I was tremendously grateful. <br> &nbsp;<br> I handled the tape recorder, transcribed our conversations myself, and presented the manuscript to him for corrections. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Come to think of it, I&#x2019;ve never really talked about music like this before, in such a focused, organized way.&#x201d; This was the very first thing Ozawa said to me after reading the finished manuscript. &#x201c;But wow, my language is so rough! Do you think readers are going to understand what I&#x2019;m saying?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> It&#x2019;s true, the maestro does speak his own special brand of Ozawa-ese, which is not always easy to convert to standard written Japanese. He gesticulates grandly, and many of his thoughts emerge in the form of songs. Still, whatever &#x201c;roughness&#x201d; there may be in the way he expresses himself, the feeling he seeks to convey comes through with startling immediacy, overarching the &#x201c;wall of words.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Despite being an amateur (or perhaps because of it), whenever I listen to music, I do so without preconceptions, simply opening my ears to the more wonderful passages and physically taking them in. When those wonderful passages are there, I feel joy, and when some parts are not so wonderful, I listen with a touch of regret. Beyond that, I might pause to think about what makes a certain passage wonderful or not so wonderful, but other musical elements are not that important to me. Basically, I believe that music exists to make people happy. In order to do so, those who make music use a wide range of techniques and methods which, in all their complexity, fascinate me in the simplest possible way.<br> &nbsp;<br> I tried my best to preserve this attitude when listening to what Maestro Ozawa had to say. In other words, I tried my best to remain an honest and curious amateur listener on the assumption that most of the people reading this book would be amateur music fans like me.<br> &nbsp;<br> *******<br> &nbsp;<br> At the risk of sounding somewhat presumptuous, I confess that in the course of our many conversations, I began to suspect that Seiji Ozawa and I might have several things in common. Questions of talent or productivity or fame aside, what I mean here is that I can feel a sense of identity in the way we live our lives.<br> &nbsp;<br> First of all, both of us seem to take the same simple joy in our work. Whatever differences there might be between making music and writing fiction, both of us are happiest when absorbed in our work. And the very fact that we are able to become so totally engrossed in it gives us the deepest satisfaction. What we end up producing as a result of that work may well be important, but aside from that, our ability to work with utter concentration and to devote ourselves to it so completely that we forget the passage of time is its own irreplaceable reward.<br> &nbsp;<br> Secondly, we both maintain the same &#x201c;hungry heart&#x201d; we possessed in our youth, that persistent feeling that &#x201c;this is not good enough,&#x201d; that we must dig deeper, forge farther ahead. This is the major motif of our work and our lives. Observing Ozawa in action, I could feel the depth and intensity of the desire he brought to his work. He was convinced of his own rightness and proud of what he was doing, but not in the least satisfied with it. I could see he knew he should be able to make the music even better, even deeper, and he was determined to make it happen even as he struggled with the constraints of time and his own physical strength.<br> &nbsp;<br> The third of our shared traits is stubbornness. We&#x2019;re patient, tough, and, finally, just plain stubborn. Once we&#x2019;ve decided to do something in a certain way, it doesn&#x2019;t matter what anybody else says, that&#x2019;s how we&#x2019;re going to do it. And even if, as a result, we find ourselves in dire straits, possibly even hated, we will take responsibility for our actions without making excuses. Ozawa is an utterly unpretentious person who is constantly cracking jokes, but he is also extremely sensitive to his surroundings, and his priorities are clear. Once he has made his mind up, he doesn&#x2019;t waver. Or at least that is how he appears to me.<br> &nbsp;<br> I have met many different people in the course of my life, some of whom I have come to know pretty well, but where these three traits are concerned, I had never encountered anyone before Seiji Ozawa with whom I found it so easy and natural to identify. In that sense, he is a precious person to me. It sets my mind at ease to know that there is someone like him in the world.<br> &nbsp;<br> Of course, we are also different in many ways. For example, I lack his easy sociability. I do have my own sort of curiosity about other people, but in my case it rarely comes to the surface. As a conductor of orchestras, Ozawa is quite naturally in touch with a large number of people on a daily basis and has to act as the guiding member of a team. But no matter how talented he might be, people would not follow him if he were constantly moody and difficult. Interpersonal relations take on a great significance. A conductor needs like-minded musical colleagues, and he is often called upon to perform social and even entrepreneurial tasks. He has to give much thought to his audiences. And as a musician, he has to devote a good deal of energy to the guidance of the next generation.<br> &nbsp;<br> By contrast, as a novelist I am free to spend my life hardly seeing or talking to anyone for days at a time, and never appearing in the media. I rarely have to do anything that involves teamwork, and while it&#x2019;s best to have some colleagues, I don&#x2019;t especially need any. I just have to stay in the house and write&#x2014;alone. The thought of guiding the next generation has never crossed my mind, I&#x2019;m sorry to say (not that anyone has ever asked me to do such a thing). I&#x2019;m sure there are significant differences in mentality that come from such differences in our professional functions, not to mention innate personality differences. But I suspect that on the most basic level, deep down in the bedrock, our similarities outnumber our differences.<br> &nbsp;<br> Creative people have to be fundamentally egoistic. This may sound pompous, but it happens to be the truth. People who live their lives watching what goes on around them, trying not to make waves, and looking for the easy compromise are not going to be able to do creative work, whatever their field. To build something where there was nothing requires deep individual concentration, and in most cases that kind of concentration occurs in a place unrelated to cooperation with others, a place we might even call <i>d�monisch</i>.<br> &nbsp;<br> Still, letting one&#x2019;s ego run wild on the assumption that one is an &#x201c;artist&#x201d; will disrupt any kind of social life, which in turn interrupts the &#x201c;individual concentration&#x201d; so indispensable for creativity. Baring the ego in the late nineteenth century was one thing, but now, in the twenty-first century, it is a far more difficult matter. Creative professionals constantly have to find those realistic points of compromise between themselves and their environment<br> &nbsp;<br> What I am trying to say here is that while Ozawa and I of course have found very different ways to establish those points of compromise, we are likely headed in pretty much the same direction. And while we may set very different priorities, the way we set them may be quite similar. Which is why I was able to listen to his stories with something more than mere sympathy.</p><h2>Matisse, Picasso, Miro--as I Knew Them</h2><p>Rosamond Bernier went to France in 1946 as &#34;Vogue&#34; features editor and stayed there for the next two decades, during which time she formed close and enduring friendships with many of the greatest painters of the 20th century, most particularly Matisse, Picasso and Miro. Reluctant though they were to reveal themselves to outsiders, Ms Bernier had their trust to a remarkable extent and each of them talked to her, as to few others, for hours at a time. From these conversations she gleaned not only a fund of personal and moving reminiscences, but also an understanding of the artists&#39; work, lives and milieu. In this book, Ms Bernier captures the substance of these conversations, interweaving anecdote, description of each man&#39;s artistic concerns and photographs. She writes of her exploration of Barcelona with Miro as her guide, and her visit to Matisse when he explained to her, page by page, his illustrations of Mallarme&#39;s &#34;Poesies&#34;, as well as numerous other memories.</p><p>Bernier's first book is a reshaping of her slide and lecture series often given at the Metropolitan Museum of Art and elsewhere. The author, wife of art critic John Russell and founding editor of L'OEil, writes splendidly of her three artists on a personal level and covers a lot of ground artistically without ever getting in very deep or stopping for a rich examination of the works at hand. She always charms, however, especially when revealing lost treasures that she discovered firsthand. (The book's 350 illustrations, including 200 color, seen largely in b&amp;w photocopy, give every indication of being knockouts.) Despite moments of evident warmth the artists showed her, Bernier's day-to- day reminiscences of her three heroes reinforce what we already know of them, and at times bring these men popping off the page with a line or two of dialogue without offering fresh insight into their work. Her stories cover the first 20 years in France following WW II, when her magazine was at its peak (it changed hands in 1969) and when, through her ``genius for friendship'' (as her husband puts it), she was gathering fresh material for L'OEil. Perhaps her biggest strike was a big cache of Picasso works the painter had left with his family in Barcelona 50 years earlier and that he directed her tomany were black with grime but when cleaned revealed the teenage artist's astounding facility as a realist. Bernier's most captivating passage about Matisse concerns the bedridden artist's slowly evolving plans and inspiration for the Chapelle de Sainte-Marie-du-Rosaire at Vence and the sudden impetus to his work that thoughts of stained-glass windows in strong sunlight gave him. Mir� tells her about his painting of The Farm, which turned out to be too big for any dealer to sell; the young Hemingway bought it ``for pennies, but he liked it a lot.'' A moveable feast.

Founder of the art journal L'OEil , which she edited until 1969, she was a friend and associate of many famous artists, including the trio profiled in this snazzily illustrated book, replete with 350 reproductions and photographs (200 in color), and based on her lectures at New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art. In southern France she met Matisse, "a benign figure of Edwardian elegance," a world traveler who "made everywhere work for him," whether he was in Morocco, Tahiti, Saint Tropez or Spain. She limns Picasso as a man of multiple selves, "Prince Charming and Jack the Ripper" all in one. In Barcelona she befriended Miro, seen here as a dark surrealist visionary "eaten alive by his visions," rather than the purveyor of gentle whimsy beloved of the public. Bernier's enchanting reminiscences are rich in anecdote and insight. 40,000 first printing; BOMC selection; author tour. <br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Leaving the 20th Century: The Incomplete Work of the Situationist International</h2><p>First published in 1974, &#39;Leaving..&#39; was the first collection of Situationist writing in English.

He translated Raoul Vaneigem&#39;s Banalites de Base (as The Totality for Kids) and is the author of Leaving the Twentieth Century, the first English language anthology of Situationist ideas, and the biography Life of Osho.Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: French</p><h2>Life is Just What You Make It: My Story So Far</h2><p>At age five, Donny Osmond first sang his way into North Americas heart. By the time he was a teenager, he had four separate careers successfully underway, as a solo artist, as a member of the Osmond Brothers, as part of a singing duo with his sister, Marie, and as the co-host of a highly successful network television variety show. But by the early 80s, public perception had changed, and Donny discovered that, thanks to his squeaky-clean image, his very name had become poison. In this inspiring autobiography, Donny tells what it is like to survive the ups and downs of the entertainment business while trying to keep his faith, dignity, and sense of humor intact. He recalls memories of his experiences with a variety of celebrities, from Groucho Marx and Lucille Ball to Michael Jackson and Howard Stern. He shares how he finally achieved resolution through marriage, fatherhood, perseverance, and self-acceptance. And he recounts the long and difficult road leading to a renewed recording career, nearly two thousand triumphant performances in Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat, and a new nationally syndicated talk show. The millions of people who watched Donny grow up are now embracing the man whose life and career exemplify the classic values that so many now share.</p><p><strong>Donny Osmond</strong> has worked in the entertainment industry for more than forty years as a singer, songwriter, musician, and actor. His popularity as an all-round entertainer continues to grow and, as well as hosting the successful television program <em>The Donny &amp; Marie Show</em> with his sister, he starred in Sir Andrew Lloyd Webber's <em>Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat</em> for six years. In 2004 he performed to a sell-out UK concert tour, and released his 54th album to commercial and critical acclaim.<br><br> <strong>Patricia Romanowski</strong> is the award-winning co-editor of <em>The New Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock &amp; Roll</em>. She lives on Long Island with her husband, author Philip Bashe, and their son, Justin."Change your name. Your name is poison," advised Michael Jackson when Donny Osmond was trying to forge an adult singing career in 1983. Osmond's name was not always a punch line. At the age of five, he joined his four older siblings as the pop group The Osmonds. Barely in his teens, Donny became a solo artist, cutting more than 20 gold records by the mid-'70s. From 1976 to 1979, he and his sister starred in the popular, campy TV variety series The Donny &amp; Marie Show. But his toothy, wholesome image and his strict religious beliefs as a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints were at odds with the harder-edged rock of that era. This, and the fact that the Osmond entertainment empire was located in distant Utah, fostered the impression that he was a has-been by age 22. Osmond's emotionally raw and startlingly candid autobiography is a difficult tightrope act: a triumph-of-the-spirit tale that avoids homilies or bitterness. Taught to ignore his own feelings in favor of the interest of the family, Osmond was a child star under enormous pressure to be "perfect." His debilitating panic attacks (which plagued his five-year run in Andrew Lloyd Webber's Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat) and his efforts to find emotional peace through psychotherapy are recounted with bracing honesty, and he provides keen insights into the music business, especially the behind-the-scenes politics that govern radio airtime. By the end of his story (so far), Osmond's long-sought inner peace includes the understanding that he can't control how he is perceived by the public. Writing this book may have been the best form of therapy for Osmond, but it will prove a revelation to readers as well.

Griffith, Director (Rutgers Films in Print, 21)</h2><p>The Birth of a Nation (1915) remains the most controversial American film ever made, and its director, D. W. Griffith, one of the most extraordinary figures in film history. It was the first true feature film and did more than any other to launch Hollywood both as an industry and as an idea. The film consolidated a trend in cinematic technique and an approach to dramatic narrative that define American cinema to this day. As a great but ideologically troubled film that offers us a reflection of ourselves as Americans, The Birth of a Nation continues to intrigue, challenge, infuriate, and awe.<br><br> Robert Lang's introduction to this volume explores in fascinating detail the warped view of history that this great film presents. Griffith, a Southerner, was intent on resurrecting, idealizing, and justifying the South. In The Birth of a Nation, it is racism that unites the white North and South; the protection or abolition of slavery is not the divisive issue. In a powerful synthesis of spectacle and narrative, Griffith seeks to give the Southern cause a sense of glamour and high purpose. Lang considers the film as a historical melodrama, and by examining Griffith's "historiography as ideological practice," he traces the way in which the bloody, traumatic reality of the Civil War and Reconstruction becomes melodramatic myth. This unparalleled guide to The Birth of a Nation offers a shot-by-shot continuity script; a biographical sketch of the director; a sampling of contemporary reviews; a series of essays by distinguished critics including James Chandler, Michael Rogin, Janet Staiger, and Mimi White; and a filmography and bibliography.</p><p>This unparalleled guide to The Birth of a Nation offers a shot-by-shot continuity script; a biographical sketch of the director; a sampling of contemporary reviews; and a series of essays.Robert Lang is an assistant professor of English and film studies at the University of Hartford.</p><h2>Poems: selected and new, 1950-1974</h2><p>Bound in the publisher&#39;s original black cloth covered boards, spine stamped in gilt.

Like the others, SLOUCHING TOWARD UTOPIA features trenchant commentary on contemporary politics and culture, couched in graceful and limpid prose. In addition to reviews of Samuel Huntington, Ivan Illich, Alexander Cockburn, and Mark Lilla, along with a dozen others, there is a symposium contribution on identity politics, two long interviews about intellectuals and American politics, and the title essay, a lecture offering an original meditation on how to get past the conventional wisdom about political morality and begin to at least stumble toward utopia.<br>Samuel Moyn has called George Scialabba "a national treasure of long standing" and "our preeminent chronicler of American public intellectuals," and says that "this new collection of his inimitable essays and reviews is one every serious reader needs." Art Goldhammer calls SLOUCHING TOWARD UTOPIA "a collection of elegant, erudite, eminently humane meditations...that illuminate these dark days of the Republic with admirable intellectual rigor. [Scialabba's] is a quiet voice that needs to be heard above the raucous cacophony that dominates our public space." In his Foreword to SLOUCHING TOWARD UTOPIA, Jedediah Purdy praises Scialabba for writing "lucidly about benightedness, vividly about purblindness, so that his essays and reviews show thought as a thing possible in a world that can seem a conspiracy against sense and reason."<br>George worked for 35 years in building management at Harvard University in order to support his book-reviewing habit.

Yet while American medicine has never been better, angst over American health care has never been greater. Why is American health care such a mess? In this path-breaking book--Nobel laureate Milton Friedman calls it &#34;fascinating and thorough&#34;--Dr. David Gratzer goes to the heart of the problem, showing that the crisis in American health care stems largely from its addiction to outmoded and discredited economic ideas. What needs to be done? Dr. Gratzer mounts a bold and provocative argument, rejecting the conventional wisdom that socialized health care is compassionate and that top-down government agencies like the FDA actually save lives. Instead, he prescribes a strong dose of capitalism. The Cure offers a detailed overview of American health care, from economics and politics to medical science. Weighing in on the most controversial topics in health care, Dr. Gratzer makes the case that it&#39;s possible to reduce health expenses, insure millions more, and improve quality of care while not growing government or raising taxes. An award-winning author and essayist, he is a master storyteller, enlivening his book with anecdotes, interviews, and stories drawn from his own extensive clinical experience. He details the cardiac woes of Robert E. Lee and Dick Cheney, describes a chat over coffee with Canada&#39;s foremost private medical entrepreneur (an acquaintance of Fidel Castro, as it happens), and explains the evolution of his own thinking, from advocating HillaryCare as a medical student to promoting individual choice and competition today. The patient is in critical condition; Dr. Gratzer diagnoses the disease and prescribes the cure.</p><p>"David Gratzer is a practicing psychiatrist who combines firsthand knowledge of medical practice in both his native Canada and the U.S. with an independent point of view and a rare capacity for lucid exposition of complex technical material. . . If you want a well-written, interesting yet authoritative and thorough account of what is wrong with medicine today and how to cure American health care, this is the book for you."<p> - <b>Milton Friedman</b>, Nobel Laureate, Economics (from foreword to The Cure)</p><p> "The Cure is a must read for all students of health care policy. Dr. Gratzer correctly diagnoses the U.S. health care system's problems and proposes workable solutions to fix them. His ideas will help reign-in costs while, at the same time, preserve necessary incentives for quality-of-life enhancing innovations." </p><p> --<b>John F. Cogan</b>, Senior Fellow, The Hoover Institution, Stanford University</p><p> "David Gratzer's well written book should be in the reading list of anyone interested in health care reform. In five-sixths of the U.S economy, we look to markets as an organizing mechanism; in the one-sixth of the economy represented by health care, public policy has frustrated markets, with adverse consequences for cost, access, and quality. Gratzer's capitalist manifesto is a shot in the arm; with it, the much that's right with American health care can grow." </p><p> --<b>R. Glenn Hubbard</b>, Dean and Russell L. Carson Professor of Finance and Economics, Columbia Business School; and former Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers.</p><p> "The caduceus is an apt symbol for medicine, given the bureaucratic snake pit the American health care system has become. Dr. David Gratzer skillfully wields Occam's razor to shave away the Byzantine rhetoric and show us that the cure for health care comes in the simplest of formulas - free markets, less government meddling, and a healthy dose of capitalism."</p><p> --<b>Governor Bill Owens</b>, Colorado</p><p> "Dr. David Gratzer is uniquely qualified to diagnose and provide a treatment regimen for the US health care system's problems. In this book he performs this function for us, does it with his usual acumen and clarity. He leads us by the hand through the labyrinth of legal, institutional and regulatory events that brought to the point where, at least to some, we are in a health crisis that can only be solved by further movement away from the market and toward a universal centrally controlled system. He thoroughly debunks the notion we can improve the US health care system by becoming more like our neighbors to the North. After taking us there, he shows us why these same legal, institutional, and regulatory events are largely responsible for our predicament and that the popular solution of more of the same is not the answer. He convincingly demonstrates that the only way out is less regulation of, and more freedom for, the providers and customers of health care. This book should be read by anyone involved, or with the hope or potential to be involved, in determining health care policy."</p><p> --<b>Tom Saving, Director</b>, Private Enterprise Research Center at Texas A&amp;M University.</p><p> "Excellent addition to the emerging call for empowering patients rather than government bureaucrats with control of the health care dollar, written by someone with an expert view from the inside!"</p><p> --<b>Scott W. Atlas</b>, MD, Senior Fellow, Hoover Institution, Professor, Stanford University School of Medicine</p><p></p>David Gratzer, a licensed physician in the US and Canada, is a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute. His research interests include Medicare and Medicaid, drug reimportation, and FDA reform. <p>Nobel laureate Milton Friedman authored the foreword to Dr. Gratzer's newest book, referring to him as "a natural-born economist." In The Cure: How Capitalism Can Save American Health Care (Encounter Books, October 2006), Dr. Gratzer offers a detailed overview of American health care and makes the case that it's possible to reduce health expenses, insure millions more, and improve quality of care without growing government or raising taxes. </p><p>Dr. Gratzer is the author of Code Blue: Reviving Canada's Health Care System (ECW Press, 1999) and is the editor of Better Medicine (ECW Press, 2002), a collection of essays from leading health care thinkers in North America and Europe.

This fascinating heroine worked in the silver mines and had two scandalous marriages, one to a philandering opium addict and one to a Senator and silver baron worth $24 million in the late 19th century. A divorcee shunned by Denver society, Lizzie raised two daughters in a villa where 100 peacocks roamed the lawns, entertained Sarah Bernhardt when the actress performed at Tabor&#39;s Opera House, and after her second husband&#39;s death, moved to a one-room shack at the Matchless Mine in Leadville. She lived the last 35 years of her life there, writing down thousands of her dreams and noting visitations of spirits on her calendar. Hers is the tale of a fiercely independent woman who bucked all social expectations by working where 19thcentury women didn&#39;t work, becoming the key figure in one of the West&#39;s most scandalous love triangles, and, after a devastating stock market crash destroyed Tabor&#39;s vast fortune, living in eccentric isolation at the Matchless Mine.

Now dramatic oil paintings by award winner Bernie Fuchs capture the spirit, strength, and stamina of one young rider, Johnny Free, as he and his beloved pony, JennySoo, set off at top speed. After racing with his Paiute friend, Little Grey Wolf, Johnny goes on to face unexpected danger--and only JennySoo can save his life.</p><p>Kindergarten-Grade 4--Although the Pony Express operated for only 18 months, the courage and daring of the young men who made these trips, battling severe weather, treacherous terrain, and hostile Indians, have become legendary. Fuchs has drawn on numerous historical accounts to create a fictionalized story of such a run. Readers follow young Johnny Free and his faithful pony, JennySoo, as they ride "like the wind," are watched by wolves, find their relief station burned to the ground, and are eventually attacked by hostile Paiutes. In a minor stretch of credulity, JennySoo returns to rescue her wounded master. The nicely paced, tightly written text captures the excitement and drama of the situation. The full-page, textured paintings carry the action forward, while their misty quality suggests a time gone by. An opening storyteller's note provides necessary background and an informative afterword provides more details about the Pony Express. This is a good introduction to the subject for youngsters not quite ready for Steven Kroll's longer and strictly factual <i>Pony Express!</i> (Scholastic, 2000). <i>--Grace Oliff, Ann Blanche Smith School, Hillsdale, NJ</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Until recently, however, the treatment of prophecy has been either apologetic or expository, and prophetic themes have been developed individually apart from their relation to the whole revealed prophetic program. Much of our knowledge has been only fragmentary and unrelated. Dr. Dwight Pentecost&#39;s monumental text, Things to Come, has changed all that. In this massive, highly successful book, Dr. Pentecost has synthesized the whole field of prophecy into a unified biblical doctrine, a systematic and complete biblical eschatology. With nearly a quarter of a million copies sold, Things to Come has earned its place in the library of the pastor, the scholar, and the seminarian or Bible institute student. In addition, it offers a comprehensive and accessible study for anyone interested in the important subject of biblical prophecy.</p><p>J.

Her death marked the end of an era; she was the last of the great courtesans. Known as La Belle Otero, she was a volcanic Spanish beauty whose patrons included Kaiser Wilhelm II, the Prince of Wales (later King Edward VII) and Grand Duke Nicholas of Russia. She accumulated an enormous fortune, but gambled it all away. <i>Scarlet Women</i> tells her story and many more, including:</p><p>Marie Duplessis, who inspired characters by both Dumas and Verdi;<br>Clara Ward, a rare American courtesan who hunted for a European aristocrat, but having married a Belgian prince, ran away with a gypsy violinist;<br>Ninon de L'Enclos, who was offered 50,000 crowns by Cardinal Richelieu for one night. Money left in her will paid for Voltaire's education.</p><p>Courtesans were an elite group of talented, professional mistresses. The most successful became wealthy and famous in their own right. While they led charmed lives, they occupied a curious position: they enjoyed freedom and political power unknown to most women, but they were ostracised by polite society. From the hetaerae of ancient Greece to the cortigiani onesti of 16th century Venice, the oiran of Edo-period Japan to the demimondaines of 19th century France, this captivating book--perfect for readers of <i>A Treasury of Royal Scandals</i>--uncovers the rich, colorful lives of these women who dared to pursue fortunes outside their societies' norms.</p></p><p>IAN GRAHAM is the author of THE ULTIMATE BOOK OF IMPOSTERS, as well as more than 200 children&#39;s non-fiction books on a wide range of topics.

Julio Cort�zar</p><p>As Juan Gelman's name begins appearing with regularity on lists predicting Noble-Laureate-deserving poets, his work has also begun to appear in English. But only now are the most stunning translations of Gelman's poetry being published, and in one substantial volume. <i>Dark Times Filled with Light</i> traces the evolution of a gifted lyrical poet&#x2019;s encounter with the political, when the poet&#x2019;s son and daughter-in-law become 'disappeared' by the Argentinian government, and the poet must write from both a literal and metaphysical exile.</p><p>In this posthumously realized labor of love by the legendary translator Hardie St. Martin, Gelman's staggering biography, and the poetics he developed to articulate and survive it, are unforgettably translated into beautiful and accessible poems that, taken together, weave a fragile but healing transformation. "There are losses," says Gelman in a moving understatement. "The important thing is how returning to them transforms them into something new."</p><p><b>Juan Gelman</b> is one of the most-read poets in Argentina, and a noted political activist. Among his most recent awards are the Juan Rulfo Prize, the Pablo Neruda Prize, and the Cervantes Prize.</p><p><b>Hardie St. Martin</b> was a master translator.

Indeed, Gelman's poetry in translation extends the range and capacity of our own speech, poetic art, and sensibility."&#x2014;<i>Big Bridge Press Reviews</i></p><p>"There is no question that <i>Dark Times Filled with Light</i> is a significant, moving, and beautiful addition to poetry available in English.

Unfortunately, they also see me. </p><p> One of the first lessons a necromancer learns is the art of playing dumb. When strolling down Fifth Avenue, searching for that perfect pair of shoes, pay no attention to the guy in the Civil War uniform. If he notices the glow that marks you as a necro, he will attempt to make conversation. Pretend you don't see him. With practice, you'll learn to finesse the act -- pursing your lips, tilting your head, murmuring "Hmm, I thought I heard -- Oh my God, would you look at those darling Jimmy Choos!" </p><p> Eventually, the ghost will decide you're untrained -- or just plain stupid -- and wander off before getting to the part that begins with "Say, could you do me a favor...?" Of course, one problem with playing dumb is that it seeps into your everyday life. But that has its advantages too. No one ever asks me to help with their taxes. </p><p> Now, as I stood behind the stage curtain, I searched for signs of any otherworldly presences. Nothing screws up a s�ance like the appearance of a real ghost. </p><p> In the theater, my intro began: "This is their world. A world of peace and beauty and joy. A world we all wish to enter." </p><p> I tensed, flexing my calf muscles. </p><p> "Jaime..." Brett warned as he fixed my hair. "Stand still or this piece is going to wave like a bug antenna." </p><p> Achieving an artlessly windswept updo is, truly, an art form, but it was part of the "sexy librarian" look I used for my shows. The pinned-up red hair, the modestly cut but curve-hugging dress and, of course, the wire-rimmed glasses. Admittedly, at forty-six, I was ramming the limit of how much longer there would be any "sexy" in my librarian. Keep the house lights low, though, and I looked damned hot. </p><p> My cue came. I walked to the curtain, cheeks twitching as I struggled to keep my smile in, reminding myself I'd need it for the next two hours. </p><p> As I stepped onto the dimly lit catwalk, I could hear the breathing of the sold-out crowd. Their excitement ignited mine and my grin broke through. I bit my cheek and set out. </p><p> "Come with me now," my recorded whisper snaked through the hushed theater. "Let me take you into their world. The world of the spirits." </p><p> I stopped. The speakers hissed as the recording switched to a man's voice. </p><p> "The Globe Theater proudly presents... internationally renowned spiritualist..." Another hiss as the volume swelled, the house lights rising with it. "Jaime Vegas!" </p><p> "I'm getting a male relative," I said to Patty, a round-faced woman with big tortoiseshell glasses straight out of the eighties. "His name starts with N...no, wait...M. Yes, M." </p><p> Statistically speaking, M is one of the most common first letters for male given names. Somewhere in Patty's mental file, she'd find a deceased Mike, a Matthew or... </p><p> "Mort!" she shrieked, like she'd correctly answered the Double Jeopardy question. "My uncle Mort." </p><p> "Yes, that's right. Your moth..." I drew out the word, watching for her reaction. At her frantic nod, I said decisively, "Your mother's brother." </p><p> Interpreting cues was the key to cold reading. Sometimes it was only a slight widening of the eyes or a faint involuntary nod. Then I'd get people like Patty, so eager to praise and encourage me that I felt like a puppy who'd finally piddled outside. </p><p> I spent the next few minutes postponing the inevitable message, with "Wait, he's fading...no, here he comes...I think he's trying to say something..." It's a two-hour show. </p><p> I was in the midst of "reeling" Mort back when a voice said, "You called?" </p><p> I glanced behind me. There stood a sixtyish bald man with a round face, bearing a striking resemblance to Patty. Uncle Mort. It doesn't matter that I rarely summon ghosts onstage. Sometimes they just show up. </p><p> "Mortimer!" I beamed a smile as his gaze nestled in my cleavage. "How wonderful. I thought I'd lost you." </p><p> "Uncle Mort?" Patty bounced, clearing her seat by a good three inches. "It's me, Patty." </p><p> Mort squinted. "Patty? Shit. I thought you said Pammy, her sister." His eyes rolled back as he smiled. "Mmm. Pammy. She was always the cute one, but after she turned sixteen? Boom." He gestured to show what part of Pammy's anatomy had exploded. </p><p> "Uncle Mort would like to tell your sister, Pammy, that he's thinking of her." </p><p> "Ask her if Pammy's still hot," Mort said. "Last time I saw her was at my funeral. She wore this lacy little black number. And no panties." He chortled. "That's one good thing about being a ghost -- " </p><p> "Uncle Mort remembers that black silk dress Pammy wore to his funeral." </p><p> If Patty bounced any higher, she was going to take flight. "What about me? Does he remember me?" </p><p> "Yeah," Mort said. "The fat one. Even as a baby she was a little tub of lard -- " </p><p> "Uncle Mort says he remembers what a beautiful baby you were, so cute and chubby with red cheeks like apples." </p><p> Patty spent the next few minutes telling Uncle Mort about Cousin Ken's cataracts and Aunt Amy's arthritis and little Lulu's lazy eye. Uncle Mort ignored her, instead peppering me with questions about Pammy. </p><p> "Are you even listening to me?" Mort said finally. </p><p> "Uncle Mort appreciates the update," I said. "And he'd like you to pass on a message in return. Tell everyone he misses them dearly -- " </p><p> "Miss them? One more Christmas with those people, and if the cancer didn't get me -- " </p><p> " -- but he's gone to a good place, and he's happy." </p><p> "Would I be <i>here</i> if I was happy? I'm bored out of my frigging skull." </p><p> I crouched beside Patty, clasped her hands and wished her all the best. Then I returned to the catwalk. "Uncle Mort has left us now." </p><p> Mort jumped in front of me, waving his arms. I walked through him. </p><p> "She's ignoring you," another voice said. </p><p> "I'm waiting for a new spirit to make contact," I continued. "I can sense them just beyond the veil." I pretended to scan the room, to get a look at the new arrival without letting on I'd heard him. More secrets of the successful spiritualist. </p><p> A young man had climbed onto the catwalk. Dressed in a striped Henley shirt and cargo shorts, he was about twenty, stocky, with manicured beard stubble. A frat boy, I guessed. A ghost, I knew. The fact that no one noticed him sauntering down the catwalk gave it away. </p><p> I continued to survey the room. "A spirit is trying to break through the veil..." </p><p> "Don't bother, buddy," Mort said to the other ghost. "She may be a necromancer, but she needs some serious remedial training." </p><p> "Actually, I hear she's very good. Comes from a long line of powerful necros." </p><p> "Yeah? Well, it skipped a generation." </p><p> "I have a name," I intoned, eyes half-closed. "Is there a Belinda in the audience?" In seat L15, if my sources were correct. </p><p> "See?" Mort said. "She doesn't even know we're here." </p><p> "Oh, she knows." The frat boy's voice carried a burr of condescension. "Don't you, Red?" </p><p> "Do I have a Belinda in the audience? Hoping to contact her father?" </p><p> A bingo-hall shriek as an elderly woman -- in L15 -- leapt up. I made my way over to her. Mort stomped back to his afterlife. The frat boy stayed. </p><p> After the show, I strode down the backstage hall, an icy water bottle pressed to my cheek. </p><p> My assistant, Tara, scampered along beside me. "We have a ten a.m. tomorrow with the <i>Post Intelligencer</i>, then a two o'clock pretape with KCPQ. Friday's show is totally sold-out, but you can plug the October one in Portland." </p><p> "Will do. Now, can you find Kat? Let's see if we can't get that sound system fixed before Friday." </p><p> I slipped into my dressing room, closed the door and leaned against it. A slow clapping started across the room. </p><p> The frat boy slid off my dressing table. "Okay, show's over. You done good, Red. Now it's time to get to work. Be a real necromancer." </p><p> I uncapped my water and chugged. </p><p> "Cut the crap," he said. "I know you can -- " </p><p> " -- hear you. Yes, I can." I mopped my sweaty face with a towel. "But a dressing-room ambush really isn't a good way to get my attention." </p><p> His full lips twisted. "Oh, please. You think I'm going to peep at you undressing? You're, like, forty." </p><p> "I meant it's rude." I tossed the towel aside and grabbed my hairbrush. "If you'd like to talk, meet me at the rear doors in twenty minutes." </p><p> "Um, no. I'm going to talk to you now, and I'm not leaving until I do." </p><p> Rule one of "how to win favors and influence necros"? Never threaten. I'd say if you're lucky enough to get one to listen, you should fall on your knees with gratitude. But that might be pushing it. A simple "okay, thanks" will do. </p><p> I'm not heartless. In fact, in the last few years, I've made a real effort to listen to ghosts, and I'd had every intention of hearing this one out. But he was fast blowing his chance. </p><p> I turned to the mirror and brushed out my hair, pins clinking to the floor. </p><p> "Don't turn your back on me," the ghost said. </p><p> "I'm not. I said I'll be ready in twenty minutes." </p><p> He walked through the dressing table, planting himself between the mirror and me. "Fine. How about this?" </p><p> He shimmered, then shot back, clothing drenched with blood, stomach ripped open, safety glass shards studding his intestines. A brain-splattered metal rod protruded from his ear. One eye bounced on his cheek. </p><p> I fell back. "Oh my God! No, please. Not the death body. I'll do whatever you want!" </p><p> I recovered and reached through his intestines for my cold cream. "Do you really think you're the first spook who's tried that? I've seen decapitations, burnings, drownings, bear maulings, electrocution..." I leaned to see my reflection past the rod sticking from his head. "A couple of years ago, there was this one ghost who'd been cut almost in half. Industrial accident, I guess. That one <i>did</i> give me a start. But car accidents? <i>Pfft</i>." </p><p> I met his eyes -- or the one still in its socket. "Did you see that segment on E! last month? About celebrities addicted to plastic surgery?

Portland, Or.</p><p>"The urge to collect is universal; to the botanist it is essential." Here Tanner ( Gardening America ) and Auchincloss , a member of the New York Botanical Garden's board of managers, chronicle and celebrate the collector's urge that led to the founding and flourishing of the New York Botanical Garden in New York City's borough of the Bronx. Established in 1891 by "a group of ladies and gentlemen" smitten with the horticultural wonders of England, the NYBG cost less than a million dollars to launch, and now comprises an extensive sanctuary for daffodils, crab apples, magnolias, roses, tulip trees, waterfalls, gazebos, restaurants and much else. The authors tell its story with lively dispatch yet wise digressions to the devotees who have helped keep the Garden in green: Ghillian Prance, a Scottish "veteran plant hunter" who learned the secret nocturnal life of the Victoria Amazonica water lily; Elizabeth Cornelia Hall, aka "Miss Information," who fielded botanical calls and questions on behalf of the NYBG from John Q. Public for several decades. Color photographs by Rokach show us gardens in winter, a blaze of sugar maples and a bevy of cloistered caladiums. <br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.Chartered by the city of New York in 1891, the New York Botanical Garden is a renowned center of botanical research as well as a beloved public park. In the words of the authors, the garden is "a modern encyclopedia of plants, with more than 25,000 kinds of living plants and a herbarium of over 5 million preserved specimens." And, as the 200 photographs illustrate, it is an oasis of natural beauty in an urban setting. The garden conducts educational programs for the general public, in addition to its main research work in the identification and preservation of the plant species of the world, especially those of the disappearing tropical rain forests. An important history of this influential institution, this work should attract readers interested in botanical research and patrons of the Botanical Garden itself.<br><i>- Pamela R.

One of the foremost authors of modern naval fiction, he has written many novels, including the six-volume <i>Nicholas Everard WWII</i> <i>Saga</i>.Based on a WWII secret submarine action against the German battleship TIRPITZ, Fullerton's sea story portrays British sailors speaking as English aristocracy, while enjoying tea and biscuits at battle stations. The plot is subtle, the romance cool, the action sparse, and the participants taciturn. The gravelly voiced Terry Wale adds spice to the tale by creating personalities for characters, using varying manners of speech, rhythm, and volume. However, his female falsetto holds for only a few words, before sliding into a low rasp heard from no woman.

Axel lives in London with his partner and young daughter.PreS-Gr 1-Pip and Posy are back, and Pip has a jaunty red balloon for them to share, at least for a little while. The sight of it makes everyone smile, but then, in front of the toy store, tragedy strikes. Pip accidentally lets go. The frantic chase that ensues is not enough to save the balloon from its fate at the end of a sharp branch on a tree in the park. Pip is heartbroken and does not stop crying until Posy pulls two bottles of bubbles from her backpack. Together they blow bubbles that float away and pop-just like they are supposed to. Scheffler's illustrations mirror his previous books about these endearing characters with bold colors, fun details, and evocative expressions.

Did he travel beyond the bounds of Palestine in his search for wisdom knowledge? Where did he acquire the great learning which amazed those who heard him preaching and enabled him to cross swords in debate with Scribes and Pharisees? A number of legends suggest that Jesus travelled to the British Isles with Joseph of Arimathea, who worked in the tin trade. With these legends as his starting point, Gordon Strachan uncovers a fascinating network of connections between the Celtic world and Mediterranean culture and philosophy. Taking the biblical image of Wisdom as the &#39;master craftsman&#39;, Strachan explores the deep layers of Mystery knowledge shared between the Judaic-Hellenic world and the northern Druids -- from the secret geometry of masons and builders, which Jesus would have encountered in his work as a craftsman in Palestine, to the Gematria or number coding of the Old and New Testaments.</p><p>Gordon Strachan was a Church of Scotland minister and taught at the University of Edinburgh, as well as lecturing around the world on Architecture and Sacred Geometry. He is retired and lives in Edinburgh. He is the author of Chartres: Sacred Geometry, Sacred Space (2003), The Bible&#39;s Hidden Cosmology (2005), The Return of Merlin (2006) and Prophets of Nature (2008). Gordon also featured in a documentary, And Did Those Feet, based on Jesus the Master Builder which screened at the BFI in London in 2010.&#39;A remarkable book. Jesus the Master Builder makes a significant contribution to research, suggesting connections between megalithic, Pythagorean and early Christian traditions. To convey the full picture of the ancient world that Strachan is able to weave together is beyond the scope of this review.

According to Marxist economist Samir Amin, the great upheaval that once produced the Soviet Union also produced a movement away from capitalism-a long transition that continues today. In seven concise, provocative chapters, Amin deftly examines the trajectory of Russian capitalism, the Bolshevik Revolution, the collapse of the Soviet Union, the possible future of Russia-and, by extension, the future of socialism itself. Amin manages to combine an analysis of class struggle with geopolitics-both crucial to understanding Russia&#39;s complex political history. He first looks at the development (or lack thereof) of Russian capitalism. He sees Russia&#39;s geopolitical isolation as the reason its capitalist empire developed so differently from Western Europe, and the reason for Russia&#39;s perceived &#34;backwardness.&#34; Yet Russia&#39;s unique capitalism proved to be the rich soil in which the Bolsheviks were able to take power, and Amin covers the rise and fall of the revolutionary Soviet system. Finally, in a powerful chapter on Ukraine and the rise of global fascism, Amin lays out the conditions necessary for Russia to recreate itself, and perhaps again move down the long road to socialism. Samir Amin&#39;s great achievement in this book is not only to explain Russia&#39;s historical tragedies and triumphs, but also to temper our hopes for a quick end to an increasingly insufferable capitalism.</p><p><p><strong></strong><strong>Samir Amin</strong>&nbsp;was born in Egypt in 1931 and received his Ph.D. in economics in Paris in 1957. He is director of the Third World Forum in Dakar, Senegal. His numerous works include&nbsp;<em>The Law of Worldwide Value</em>,&nbsp;<em>Eurocentrism: Second Edition</em>,&nbsp;<em>The World We Wish to See</em>,&nbsp;<em>The Liberal Virus</em>,&nbsp;<em>Accumulation on a World Scale</em>,&nbsp;<em>Imperialism and Unequal Development</em>, and&nbsp;<em>The Implosion of Contemporary Capitalism</em>.</p>"What is splendid in Amin's writing ... is his lucidity of expression, his clear consistency of approach, and, above all his absolutely unwavering condemnation of the ravages of capital and of bourgeois ideology in all its forms ... Amin remains an essential point of reference, and an inspiration." -Bill Bowring, Marx &amp; Philosophy Review of Books</p><h2>The Shelter Cycle</h2><p>An American original, Peter Rock brings our strangest beliefs to vivid and sympathetic life in this haunting novel inspired by true events.<br><br><i>The Shelter Cycle</i> tells the story of two children, Francine and Colville, who grew up in the Church Universal and Triumphant, a religion that predicted the world could end in the late 1980s. While their parents built underground shelters to withstand the impending Soviet missile strike, Francine and Colville played in the Montana wilderness, where invisible spirits watched over them. When the prophesized apocalypse did not occur, the sect&#x2019;s members resurfaced and the children were forced to grow up in a world they believed might no longer exist.<br><br>Twenty years later, Francine and Colville are reunited while searching for an abducted girl. Haunted by memories and inculcated beliefs, they must confront the Church&#x2019;s teachings. If all the things they were raised to believe were misguided, why then do they suddenly feel so true?<br></p><p><p><b>Author One-on-One: Adam Johnson and Peter Rock</b></p> <p><strong>Adam Johnson is the author of the novel <em>The Orphan Master's Son</em>, which won the 2013 Pulitzer Prize in fiction.

It seems like you create a new world for each of your books. What drew you to this realm, and how did you conjure it?</strong>&nbsp;</p> <p>Peter Rock: On a basic level I was drawn to this world because it was cool--people dressed in violet, preparing underground shelters in Montana with the prospect of living there for up to seven years, weathering the apocalypse? That intrigued me. And my curiosity was exacerbated because I was working as a ranch hand on a ranch very nearby during the time they call "the shelter cycle"--1986-1990. So it was a combination of curiosity and sentimentality that drew me back to that time. I wanted to know how why they did those things, and I also wonder how it would be to prepare for the end of the world, to go underground, and then to surface and live in a world that you believed might no longer exist. How did I conjure the world of my book? I just tried to get as deeply into the beliefs and landscape of the church, into the people, and then to write my way out.</p> <p><strong>AJ: Which makes sense, because the times we hung out during the years you were working on this book, you often seemed kind of unhinged. What were some of the challenges of trying to find your way back?</strong></p> <p>PR: I don't know that I've come all the way back, or I ever will! I mean, part of the challenge was the sheer amount of cosmology and information that I wanted to share, to convey that dramatically--the book grew to over a 1,000 pages, and now it's just over 200. Also, the process of learning about the church and talking to people exposed my own lack of spiritual beliefs, so that made the writing a different kind of journey. Finally, it was the actual people, since their real stories and my relationships with them were so crucial to the novel, but also complicated the act of writing fiction.</p> <p><strong>AJ: How did you meet these people? What were the interviews like?</strong></p> <p>PR: Well, I was fortunate to find that a young woman I knew a little, who had been a student at Reed College, where I teach, had been a child in this church, and her father had built a shelter for about ten families, seventy people. She'd moved back to Bozeman, and I think was ready to come to terms with these parts of her past (her family had left the church long ago). So, through her generosity I learned a lot, and gradually she introduced me to others, and the hours of interviews accumulated until I was in a process and series of interactions unlike any I'd know. I guess I had interviews that became uncomfortable--sometimes people got angry, or defensive, or emotional in the recollection of their past, but sometimes it was just the nature of the conversation. For instance, one man, still a believer, took hold of me and asserted that "You and I are not physical beings, we're spiritual beings in these envelopes of flesh, and we're fortunate to meet in this physical plane and be able to have this conversation"--at first I was fearful, but after a short time I realized, "hey, this isn't so different from how I understand the world."</p> <p>In a more specific way, two main things that startled me, when talking to people who'd been children in the church, really shaped my book: first, they described their childhoods so positively, so full of wonders--surrounded by invisible spirits that were protecting and helping them, given so much freedom in this beautiful landscape; they and their families had a truth that so few did, and they were using it to save the world; of course this was all in the context of the shelters, which one person described as "the coolest forts in the world," so far underground. And then the flipside of that wonder was that these same people, grown up and having left the church long ago, always found themselves revisited by the beliefs. In times of stress--danger, or life changes, pregnancy--they often found themselves decreeing (chanting) or praying these old prayers, acting in ways they thought they'd forgotten. There was this vestigial belief in them that they wished they could excise. They felt like there was something unpredictable, planted inside them, that they could not control.</p> <p><strong>AJ: I know you went into shelters. What happened down there?</strong></p> <p>PR: It was overwhelming. I mean, it was a little like traveling back to the eighties--all those artifacts, all that redwood paneling--but it was also traveling back into the memories and pasts of people I knew, and people who had since died. A little like a crypt? Or a monument to a potential future that didn't come to pass. All the children's clothing, the gas masks, the classrooms and generators, the radiation suits. And then I had this eerie sense, when down there, that I was inside my own head, walking around and around in the synapses, somehow, and living inside a story I was writing.</p>"As luminous as it is sinister and innocent, <i>The Shelter Cycle </i>is a book not quite like any other. Peter Rock renders masterfully the ferocity and intensity of bonds between childhood friends as well as adults, coupling also the inescapable loneliness and yet hope within the human soul." &#x2014; Rick Bass<br><br>"The Shelter Cycle is a stunning novel about faith and disillusionment and the lingering power of the past. In spare, lyrical prose, and with immense compassion . . . Rock's uncanny ability to combine mysticism with blunt realism is reminiscent of Flannery O'Connor." &#x2014; Tom Perrotta<br><br>"The Shelter Cycle is a beautifully crafted, beautifully felt novel. Rock's rendering of place is, as usual, flawless. He knows terrain so well, both geographical and human, where we hide and where we can be found. The writing is fierce, smart, and moving. This is the real deal." &#x2014; Percival Everett<br><br>"Certain writers are so unnervingly original their work secedes from our shared world and makes up a world of its own. With The Shelter Cycle it's clear that Peter Rock's world is the most singular and wondrous of them all." &#x2014; Susan Choi<br><br></p><h2>Granta 25: Murder, Autumn 1988</h2><p>Featured story is &#34;The Murderee,&#34; by Martin Amis.

The author combines aspects of these views-futurist, continuous historical, philosophy of history, preterist, and historical background-but favors the latter. The Book has a concrete setting in a definite period of history and deals with very real problems faced by Christians of the period. Symbols indicate powerful moral and spiritual forces involved in a violent clash in which the forces of God are ultimately triumphant. The Saints of that day found encouragement and gained the crown of victory. But the message continues to instruct and encourage God&#39;s people today. It reveals the principles of victory through righteousness and truth and the ultimate failure of all that is false. Some of the prophecies are yet to be fulfilled, such as the passing of the current order, the resurrection, the judgment, and the final reward and punishment of the righteous and the wicked. Consequently, some futurist aspects of the book are to be recognized. The first section discusses the title, author, place of writing, symbolism, date, interpretations, theme and purpose of Revelation. The second section on the ROman Empire provides the historical background for the birth and early years of Christianity. The main section of the book offers a complete, passage-by-passage commentary. Although firmly anchored in sound scholarship, it is not heavily footnoted, giving it the broadest possible appeal to serious students of God&#39;s Word.</p><p></p><h2>Musical Planets: Later Elementary Level</h2><p>(Willis).

Peter Burkholder's influential Charles Ives: The Ideas behind the Music, music scholars have succeeded in reassessing Ives's broad significance in twentieth-century American music. Yet, even as the composer's works have become the subject of intensive critical debate, careful analyses of his music have increasingly become inaccessible to all but Ives specialists. In A Union of Diversities, Larry Starr offers a new understanding of Ives's extraordinary music based on the fundamental conviction that Ives need not be a specialist's composer.<br>Starr argues that, far from being an eccentric and musically indifferent composer, Ives was genuinely engaged with the most serious and original aesthetic issues of style and coherence of his day. The key to unlocking what his music is about is style: specifically, the heterogeneity of style within a single work. Stylistic heterogeneity shatters our traditional musical expectations and simultaneously creates challenging and unprecedented expressive experiences.<br>Using as examples Ives's incredibly diverse song literature and selected orchestral works, Starr offers a fascinating overview of the composer's complex approaches to musical style. In such well-known songs as "Tom Sails Away," "General William Booth Enters Into Heaven," and "Majority," as well as such orchestral works as "Decoration Day," Ives's imaginative use of musical materials forms distinct layers that either create new composite song styles or emphasize multiplicity. Some songs, such as "Ann Street," describe physical journeys; others, such as "The Things Our Fathers Loved," evoke "mental journeys" or the process of memory. Ives's employment of musical style in these works, while appearing to disrupt traditionally conceived continuity and unity, actually creates continuity and unity on other levels of perception. The fascinating richness and ambiguities built into his works suggest complexities of perspective long associated with the visual arts and modern literature.<br>Starr does not propose a single system for analyzing the music of Ives, but rather a general procedure based on the composer's approach to his music. For Starr, "Ives was the most personal and idiosyncratic of composers, yet it was his very fidelity to his own unique conception of musical substance which led to a body of work that has come to be so profoundly meaningful and challenging to others."</p><p></p><h2>Philip Lynott: The Rocker : This Is the Story of a Cowboy&#39;s Life (Interview Series)</h2><p>This eye-opening biography traces Lynott&#39;s life from 1950s Dublin through to Thin Lizzy and his tragic death.

Rejecting the widely held opinion that work madewithout a client is "art" and work for hire is "design," Eatock challenges both categories by purposely blurring the distinction. Whether he is solving client problems or those of his own choosing, Eatock's work responds to personal fascinations and the desire to invent, discover, and present.<br><br>His commissioned works for clients include an exhibition catalog featuring sound chips, a flip book, handwritten notes, and a cover wrapped in the upholstery fabric used on London transit seating, as well as the graphic identity of the UK's <em>Big Brother</em> reality-TV series, among many others. Eatock's idea of "entrepreneurial authorship" has resulted in numerous self-published limited-edition works such as an edition of prints made using every color of Pantone's felt-tip pens and his <em>Untitled Beatles Poster</em>, which includes the lyrics from every Beatles song. Eatock's most personal self-initiated artworks share an unabashed enthusiasm for punch lines, miscommunication, and seriality: there's the search for a stone that weighs exactly one stone; a perfectly hand-drawn circle, the world's largest signed and numbered limited-edition artwork, utilitarian greeting cards, price label wrapping paper, car alarm dances, and a fruit bowl stickered with fruit labels. <br><br>The first monograph on this unconventional practitioner, <em>Daniel Eatock Imprint</em> is as unconventional as the artist himself. While utilizing and embracing the expectations of a traditional monograph, the London-based designer also challenges and subverts them, presenting works based on connections and associations through color, composition, titles, material, and format rather than in chronological or hierarchical order. Constantly oscillating between art and graphic design, this book is full of Eatock's astute observations and eccentric obsessions.</p><p>&#34;Daniel Eatock is a designer with a practised eye, able to switch from big bucks corporate and media branding - the Big Brother Eye, for example - to micro scale personal works that present an unvarnished view of the world. Eatock&#39;s work is also bound up in his website, Eatock.com, which solicits photography from like-minded individuals around the world. As a result, the designer&#39;s first monograph has the feel of a carefully curated weblog, with images that revel in juxtaposition and coincidence paired with his own playful works. It also wouldn&#39;t be an Eatock project without a slight subversion of the repetitious nature of the printed book - each copy contains a hand-drawn circle, drawn by the designer himself at a marathon session at the printing plant.&#34;Daniel Eatock is a graduate of Ravensbourne College of Design and Communication and the Royal College of Art. His independent art and design studio Eatock Ltd. focuses on both self-initiated art projects and commissioned design work.</p><h2>Telling New Mexico: A New History</h2><p>This extensive volume presents New Mexico history from its prehistoric beginnings to the present in essays and articles by fifty prominent historians and scholars representing various disciplines including history, anthropology, Native American studies, and Chicano studies.

Physically malformed and born dumb, he possesses an unusual sensitivity which he hides underneath engaging bravado.</p><p>Nick Cave was born in Australia in 1957. He moved to London with his band The Birthday Party in 1980. Four years later he founded The Bad Seeds, with whom he has made many albums. The fifteenth, Push the Sky Away, was released to great acclaim in February 2013. Cave has also written the music for several films including The Assassination of Jesse James and Lawless. And the Ass Saw the Angel was first published in 1989 and quickly became a cult classic. His second novel, The Death of Bunny Munro, was published in 2009.Australian rock musician, lyricist and actor Cave's first novel is an innovative, if wildly idiosyncratic, tall tale satirizing religious fanaticism. Euchrid Eucrow, despised ungainly son of a trapper father and "slobstress" mother, grows up mute but divinely inspired during the 1940s and '50s in fundamentalist Ukulore, a rural swamp peopled with cartoon-like sinners, tricksters, retardates and imbibers of moonshine. Euchrid--self-styled Monarch of Doghead--heeds a winsome guardian angel, along with talking beasts (the title evokes Balaam's ass), and is obsessed with human cruelty and carnality. The foundling Beth, becoming revered as a child-saint, believes Euchrid is divine; Euchrid slips into her room, and is brutally hunted down by Beth's avengers. The plot, rife with gory atrocities, is relayed through clotted, gutsy prose which ranges from poetic to rabid, and is interspersed throughout with graphs, lists, genealogies and scraps of Scripture. Although Cave's manic effort will not lure traditionalists, it may snare the more adventurous. <br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Where Do They Go When It Rains?</h2><p><p>Stef takes the twins out for a walk to the pond.

Cholene had always been the hero-Air Force Academy graduate, second woman to fly the U-2 spy plane, captain for United Airlines - she cried, begged, pleaded with God to change Cholene, but he changed Shari instead. It seems that he was much more concerned about Shari&#39;s lack of love than he was about Cholene&#39;s homosexuality. This book is Shari&#39;s personal story.</p><p>Shari Johnson&#39;s book was written as a result of her struggle as an evangelical Christian to come to terms with her daughter&#39;s homosexuality. Through this sometimes gut-wrenching, humorous, but always honest account of her journey, her desire is to help reconcile families torn apart over this issue. From her example, she hopes that readers will have more sense than I did. Shari learned that grudging acceptance was not the same as embracing her daughter Cholene for who she is.</p><h2>With Our Backs to Berlin</h2><p>In the final months of the Second World War in 1945, the German Army was in full retreat on both its Western and Eastern Fronts. British and American troops were poised to cross the River Rhine in the west, while in the East the vast Soviet war machine was steam-rolling the soldiers of the Third Reich back towards the capital, Berlin. Even in retreat, the German Army was still a force to be reckoned with and vigorously defended every last bridge, castle, town and village against the massive Russian onslaught. Tony Le Tissier has interviewed a wide range of former German Army and SS soldiers to provide ten vivid first-hand accounts of the fighting retreat that, for one soldier, ended in Hitler&#39;s Chancellery building in the ruins of Berlin in April 1945. The dramatic descriptions of combat are contrasted with insights into the human dimension of these desperate battles, reminding the reader that many of the German soldiers whose stories we read shared similar values to the average British &#39;Tommy&#39; or the American GI and were not all crazed Nazis. Illustrated with photographs of the main characters and specially commissioned maps identifying the location and course of the battles, With Our Backs to Berlin is a fascinating read for anyone who is interested in the final days of the Second World War.</p><p>Lt-Col Tony Le Tissier MBE served with the British Army&#39;s Royal Corps of Military Police intil 1977. He was British governor of the infamous Spandau Prison in Berlin from 1981-87. He lives in Frome.This is an amazing book of accounts written, with one exception, by members of the small percentage of German soldiers who emerged relatively unscathed from the final battle for Berlin in 1945. Their stories sometimes seem to show unbelievable luck, until one realises that most of their comrades were not so lucky and were killed; a few survived and these are their stories. As stated in the other revues, Willi Rogmann's account seems incredible. Yet he received medals for actions which were equally incredible and were fully documented. Writing as someone who spent 11 years in Germany and therefore has some understanding of the German psyche and social interactions, I believe Rogmann's story. The description is heavily flavoured by his opinions, of course, but it's clear that he was a uniquely positive-minded individual who simply never gave up trying 100% when most of us would have decided enough was enough. That saw him through where a great many others didn't make it. It would make a heck of a film! --By Tony H<br><br>This is an excellent and gripping collection of first-hand accounts from former German Army and SS soldiers who were involved in the defence of their fatherland, mainly in the last few weeks of the war around Berlin. It provides many insights into the nature of loyalty, bravery and what is like to take place in desperate defence without any real hope of ultimate victory. It should be of interest to anyone interested in what is was like to serve in the German forces at that time. It is true that the account given in the last chapter of the book "The Band of the Leibstandarte-SS Adolf Hitler" by Willi Rogmann does seem a bit far-fetched in places. However in the Appendix the author does invite the reader to assess the credibility of his story. Rogmann's skill as a soldier and bravery are however matters of record, as documented in the Commendations detailed in the Appendix. --By William Cummings<br><br>I have just read the book.

True, there&#x2019;s a fear of pastry making among many home chefs and bakers, but Lanlard quickly dismisses such concerns not only by featuring a dozen recipes for pastry basics, but also by including a handful of quick savory and sweet dishes using store-bought dough. (Try a quick fish pie or cinnamon sticks to impress guests&#x2014;and yourself.) The color photographs are glorious (although not every recipe has such accompanying illustrations) and highlight the occasional step-by-step instructions. Food combinations are not always usual and include sausage and apple, rhubarb and strawberry tarts, and treacle and calzone (using brioche dough).

It is a beautiful subject that can be motivated and studied for its own sake. In keeping with this basic philosophy, the author has made this introductory text accessible to a wide spectrum of students, including beginning-level graduates and advanced undergraduates. The exposition is inviting, following threads of ideas, describing each as fully as possible, before moving on to a new topic. Supporting material is introduced as appropriate, and only to the degree needed. Some topics are treated more than once, according to the different contexts in which they arise. The prerequisites are minimal, requiring little more than advanced calculus and no measure theory. The text focuses on normed vector spaces and their important examples, Banach spaces and Hilbert spaces. The author also includes topics not usually found in texts on the subject. This Second Edition incorporates many new developments while not overshadowing the book&#39;s original flavor. Areas in the book that demonstrate its unique character have been strengthened. In particular, new material concerning Fredholm and semi-Fredholm operators is introduced, requiring minimal effort as the necessary machinery was already in place. Several new topics are presented, but relate to only those concepts and methods emanating from other parts of the book. These topics include perturbation classes, measures of noncompactness, strictly singular operators, and operator constants. Overall, the presentation has been refined, clarified, and simplified, and many new problems have been added.</p><p>"This excellent book provides an elegant introduction to functional analysis ... carefully selected problems ... This is a nicely written book of great value for stimulating active work by students. It can be strongly recommended as an undergraduate or graduate text, or as a comprehensive book for self-study." ---- European Mathematical Society Newsletter<br><br>From a review of the first edition: "`Charming' is a word that seldom comes to the mind of a science reviewer, but if he is charmed by a treatise, why not say so? I am charmed by this book. "Professor Schechter has written an elegant introduction to functional analysis including related parts of the theory of integral equations. It is easy to read and is full of important applications. He presupposes very little background beyond advanced calculus; in particular, the treatment is not burdened by topological `refinements' which nowadays have a tendency of dominating the picture. "The book can be warmly recommended to any reader who wants to learn about this subject without being deterred by less relevant introductory matter or scared away by heavy prerequisites." ---- American Scientist<br><br>"This is an excellent book e.g. for somebody working in applied mathematics who wants to learn operator theory from scratch. It contains a wealth of material ... presented in a very elegant way ... book is very pleasant to read." ---- Zentralblatt MATH</p><h2>Summer Moonshine</h2><p>Joe Vanringham hankers after Jane Abbott, who wants Adrian Peake, who is engaged to Joe&#39;s stepmother, a formidable, foreign princess, who is the only possible buyer for Sir Buckstone Abbott&#39;s hideous ancestral home in Berkshire.

On the Bus is a celebration of the unforgettable exploits of the Merry Pranksters, immortalized in Tom Wolfe&#39;s bestselling book. In this engrossing popular history, the spirit of the era is captured in a remarkable living chronicle, combining analysis and history with colorful additional narrative by Kesey sidekick Ken Babbs. It features over 100 never-before-seen photos by Prankster photographer Ron Bevirt, Allen Ginsberg, and others, alongside candid and insightful interviews with participants and leading countercultural figures.</p><p>In the effort to offer a "complete guide" to the legendary psychedelic bus trip taken by Kesey and 13 other "pranksters" in 1964, this book lacks only a bound-in tab of LSD-25 to make it the real thing. Candid and whacky photos taken during the trip convey a generation's abandonment to drug-induced ecstasy in a way that words cannot--although words there are aplenty here. Interviews with participants and witnesses, a hybrid essay/fantasy by prankster Babbs, excerpts from Tom Wolfe 's The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test attempt to capture the unruly energies of a motley but winning crew. Of most interest to serious fans of those days are the interviews by Perry (former editor of Running magazine), in which, for example, the literary origins of Kesey's band in Palo Alto--Larry McMurtry, Robert Stone, Gordon Lish, Wallace Stegner at nearby Stanford--are restored to the myth. (Stone's refusal to aggrandize the "birth of counterculture"--"Still, we were rather pleased with ourselves. . . . We kept our world small"--is a nice counterbalance to the broader claims made elsewhere.) Perry's careful reconstruction of the nine-city trip has its wonders, too, such as the meeting with a surly, intoxicated Jack Kerouac who, upon seeing a "throne" prepared for him by the Pranksters with an American flag draped over it, "mute and quiet . . . took the flag and folded it up neatly and put it over the side." <br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Case of the Terrified Typist</h2><p>The ever-popular lawyer-cum-sleuth returns in another installment of the original series, struggling to track down a female typist who holds the key to a gem-smuggling operation and a murder. Reissue.</p><p>Born in Malden, Massachusetts, Erle Stanley Gardner left school in 1909 and attended Valparaiso University School of Law in Indiana for just one month before he was suspended for focusing more on his hobby of boxing than his academic studies. Soon after, he settled in California, where he taught himself the law and passed the state bar exam in 1911. The practise of law never held much interest for him, however, apart from as it pertained to trial strategy, and in his spare time he began to write for the pulp magazines that gave Dashiell Hammett and Raymond Chandler their start. Not long after the publication of his first novel, The Case of the Velvet Claws, featuring Perry Mason, he gave up his legal practice to write full time. He had one daughter, Grace, with his first wife, Natalie, from whom he later separated. In 1968 Gardner married his long-term secretary, Agnes Jean Bethell, whom he professed to be the real &#39;Della Street&#39;, Perry Mason&#39;s sole (although unacknowledged) love interest. He was one of the most successful authors of all time and at the time of his death, in Temecula, California in 1970, is said to have had 135 million copies of his books in print in America alone.</p><h2>Der Tiger: Schwere Panzerabteilung: Volume 2 (English and German Edition)</h2><p>Schwere Panzerabteilung 502 fought on the battlefields of Russia.

Carlton and Lejnieks, who organized the bee, decided to chronicle the group's quilting year in a book. To several of these quilters, &#x201c;modern&#x201d; seems to mean &#x201c;wonky&#x201d;&#x2015;most of the patterns feature purposely crooked cutting and off-center piecing. A few of the projects veer into interesting territory, including a striking modern Dresden Plate and some intriguing appliqu� projects. Although the patterns leave something to be desired, social networking&#x2013;savvy quilters will be inspired and will enjoy reading about each quilter's creative process.<br><br>Block Party is a lovely book for those who want to start quilting, but feel somewhat intimidated by the scale and precision of the craft. Alissa Haight Carlton and Kristen Lejnieks, both lovers of modern quilting, formed a virtual quilting bee, where twelve quilters from all over the U.S. shared the process of making twelve quilts over the course of a year. The book shares the patterns, color stories, and processes of making for all of the quilts, along with stories of how these quilters helped each other grow new skills and feel connected through making.Block Party encompasses relaxed approaches to a number of time-honored quilt block designs, including the Nine Patch, Roman Stripe, and Dresden Plate. Step-by-step photos explain how to make each block, and an illustrated chapter on basic assembly covers backing, binding, and various quilting methods. Beginners should find everything they need to dive into quilting.What's perhaps most interesting here, though, is the collective story of how these monthly block exchanges pushed the group to learn techniques and use colors they would have never attempted otherwise, and how these "out of the comfort zone" projects deepened their quilting practice. The quilting bee is a time-honored idea, and it's nice to see it play out in the online space., CRAFT, 7/1/11</p><h2>The Great Disruption: Human Nature &amp; the Reconstitution of Social Order</h2><p>n the past thirty years, the United States has undergone a profound transformation in its social structure: Crime has increased, trust has declined, families have broken down, and individualism has triumphed over community.

From whores and highwaymen to courtiers and noblemen, from events such as the Great Plague and the Fire of London to the intimate passions of ordinary&#x2014;and extraordinary&#x2014;men and women, Amber experiences it all. But throughout her trials and escapades, she remains, in her heart, true to the one man she really loves, the one man she can never have.

At the time, all of my girlfriends had their noses buried in it, and like me they found it compulsive and compelling reading. I became a fan of the author and read all of her other novels as they were published over the years, from Star Money to Calais. But Forever Amber has remained a particular favorite of mine. <p>When I was recently asked to write an introduction to this new edition I picked up the novel again, and once more I discovered it was a genuine page-turner that had lost nothing over the years.

He goes on vacation with his family. He gets a job selling drinks. He attends his brother&#39;s wedding. He mops his sister&#39;s floor. He gives directions to a lost traveller. He eats a hamburger. He has his blood sugar tested. It all sounds so normal, doesn&#39;t it? In his new book David Sedaris lifts the corner of ordinary life, revealing the absurdity teeming below its surface. His world is alive with obscure desires and hidden motives - a world where forgiveness is automatic and an argument can be the highest form of love. Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim finds one of the wittiest and most original writers at work today at the peak of his form.</p><p>It just isn&#x2019;t fair: most of us would be lucky to be able to express ourselves in writing half as well as David Sedaris does in his new book, <i>Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim</i>. But on top of his skills with the written word, the author also has substantial gifts as a performer, and he proves this on the audio version of the book. In his essay <i>The Change in Me,</i>Sedaris remembers that his mother was good at imitating people, and it&#x2019;s clear that he takes after her. Whether he&#x2019;s doing impressions of high-voiced brother Paul, or recalling times when he and his sisters tried to win good karma by speaking and acting like well-behaved, fairytale children, Sedaris&#x2019;s nuanced performance hits the right note on both the opening, comedic stories, and the more poignant essays that tend to come later in the reading. In fact, for those who have already read some of the best stories in other publications including <i>The New Yorker</i>, the CD or cassette version of this collection is probably the best bet for furthering your appreciation of the material.<p> Sedaris&#x2019;s career is closely linked with two things: audio (he was discovered by NPR&#x2019;s Ira Glass), and the personal lives of himself and his family. In <i>Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim</i>, he describes fights with his boyfriend, and his sister-in-law&#x2019;s difficult pregnancy. When sister Lisa complains about the stories involving the family, he writes about that, too. Sedaris's latest provides more evidence that he is a great humorist, memoirist and raconteur, and readers are lucky to have the opportunity to know him so well. Perhaps they are luckier still not to know him personally. <i>--Leah Weathersby</i></p>The desperately anticipated new collection by the beloved and bestselling writer Time Magazine named America&#39;s Favorite Humorist.</p><h2>The Venetian Empire 1200-1670 (Men-at-Arms)</h2><p>The story of Venice is, to some extent, separate from that of the rest of Europe. The same could be said of the city&#39;s military history and organisation. Early in the 9th century the Venetians defeated Pepin the Frank&#39;s attempts to overawe them, and they remained, at least in theory, subject to Byzantium. Gradually, however, Venice drifted into independence; and subsequently carved out its own empire at the expense of its former Byzantine masters. The Venetians were soon famous for their roving and warlike spirit, keen business acumen and pride. This book explores the remarkable history of the city and its army from 1200 up until 1670.</p><p>Packed with specially commissioned artwork, maps and diagrams, the Men-at-Arms series is an unrivalled illustrated reference on the history, organisation, uniforms and equipment of the world&#39;s military forces, past and present.David Nicolle was born in 1944 and was educated at Highgate School.

Profiling one instrument at a time, it describes the history of music since the 1700s, when orchestras first took the formal shape familiar to us. The concise text explains the role of each instrument in the orchestra and its importance in the development of music in general. </p><p> The book lists the 50 instruments chronologically in the woodwind, brass, percussion and string sections of an orchestra. The classic instruments are included -- violin, cello, flute, oboe, clarinet, harp and more. Some instruments reflect the musical period or context in which they were most popular, such as the harpsichord in the Baroque period, and the snare drum in military parades. Among the unusual instruments is the otherworldly theremin. </p><p> A wide range of modern and archival photographs and paintings show the instruments. Entries outline their historical and country origins and the era in which they were played (e.g. Classical, Modern). Annotated illustrations explain the instrument's construction, how it is played and tuned, and its musical range. Composers, musical compositions and musicians that highlight the particular instrument are examined. For example, Baroque composer Antonio Vivalidi's contribution to the violin; inventor Adolphe Sax's tenacious promotion of his saxophone in the 1840s; and 20th century pianist Glenn Gould's controversial recordings of Bach's Goldberg Variations. </p><p> For musicians, teachers and students, and all who enjoy music, this book is a beautiful and informative tour of the orchestra and beyond. </p></p><p><p> Philip Wilkinson is a freelance writer and an author in a range of subject areas, particularly history, architecture and music.

Most of these instruments have a long history, and they have changed continuously -- and as they have evolved, music has changed, too. This book tells the story of 50 of these instruments, showing how they have developed and how they have had an effect on Western music, from the Medieval period to today.</p> <p> Players, instruments, and composers<br> There has always been a complex relationship between musicians and instrument-makers. Craftsmen have been stimulated to make new and better instruments at the request of musicians. Players have honed techniques or found different approaches to playing as they have come across unfamiliar instruments. Composers have found in the latest instruments and the abilities of their players new expressive powers that have encouraged them to write in different and exciting ways.</p> <p> The story of the violin is a good example. The great violin-makers of early-18th century Cremona, Venice, and other Italian cities made it possible for the talents of a generation of brilliant Italian violinist-composers (such as Corelli and Vivaldi) to blossom, and ultimately for the violin to dominate much of the music of the late Baroque period. Later violin-makers, inspired partly by the dazzling playing of the great virtuosos and partly by the demand for more volume as orchestras grew in size, evolved a modified design to produce a bigger sound. This in turn made possible the spectacular playing of 19th-century virtuosos like Paganini. The louder violin also helped 19th-century composers such as Brahms and Mendelssohn write their outstanding concertos for the instrument. Other instruments with a long history, from the clarinet to the piano, had a similar influence.</p> <p> Reasons for change<br> Over the centuries, instruments have evolved in many ways and for many reasons. The changes can be linked to developing technology (as with the valves on brass instruments), to player convenience (as with the appearance of the end pin that helps cellists hold their instrument firmly in one place), to great inventors or craftsmen (as with the saxophone), or to the demands of composers (as with the special tuba that Wagner commissioned for his opera orchestra).</p> <p> A major factor for change was simply musical or cultural fashion. When a prominent musician or patron took up an idea, it caught on widely and the fashion spread. The violin orchestras at the French court in the 17th and 18th centuries showed the huge potential of groups of stringed instruments playing in multi-part harmony. The advocacy of new piano designs by great pianist-composers such as Beethoven was highly influential. And 19th-century improvements to instruments like the harp made them increasingly popular.</p> <p> The instruments and their families<br> This book concentrates on the classical orchestra, together with a few instruments, such as the piano and the guitar, that sometimes appear in or alongside the orchestra. Each instrument is given a key date, which may be the date of its invention, of a major development, or of the moment when it began to make a major musical impact.</p> <p> The type of the instrument is specified, according to the system of classification devised in the early-20th century by German scholars Erich Mortiz von Hornbostel and Curt Sachs. Based on how instruments work, it divides the majority of instruments into types -- idiophones, membranophones, cordophones, and aerophones. Idiophones produce a sound when the whole body of the instrument vibrates -- for example, gongs and chimes. Membranophones are instruments like drums that make a sound when a membrane vibrates. Cordophones, such as violins, guitars, and pianos, produce their sound by means of vibrating strings. In aerophones, the movement of a column of air produces a sound, as is the case in oboes, flutes, horns, and organs.</p> <p> Another way of classifying instruments is by grouping them into the sections of the orchestra -- strings, woodwind, brass, and percussion -- and this book gives these groupings too. Again, this system is based on the way in which the instruments work. Brass instruments, for example, are in that group not because of the material they are made of, but because they produce their sound as a result of the vibration of the player's lips.</p> <p> Instruments and eras<br> All the groups of instruments have a long history, and this book tells their stories against a background of musical history stretching from the Middle Ages to the present. In the process, it uses the standard terms common in musical history to describe the key phases, from Medieval to Modern.</p> <p> The Medieval period (roughly 500 to 1400) was a vast era in which musical notation evolved and instruments were used to provide entertainment at festivities and to accompany dancing and singing. Vocal music, which featured a lot in church services, developed through many phases, but in particular from simple single-line chants to polyphony -- complex music in which different vocal parts intermingled and produced the kinds of harmonies that influenced Western music for much of the rest of its history. Medieval instruments included ancestors of many of those played today. They ranged from plucked strings such as the lute and harp, to bowed instruments like the lyra and fiddle, ancestors of the violin, and from wooden pipes resembling flutes, to the sackbut, forebear of the trombone. The Medieval period also saw the development of the first keyboard instrument, the organ.</p> <p> In the Renaissance period (in music, usually said to be 1400-1600), music shook off the conventions of medieval church music. The idea of tonality -- according to which music is written in a specific key -- became central and remained so until the 20th century. At the same time music tended to become more clearly expressive. As well as being a heyday of vocal music, it was also a boom time for instrumental music. Groups of musicians playing together in bands or consorts became common, and the instruments they played developed too. Valveless trumpets, wooden cornets, and sackbuts dominated the brass; bowed stringed instruments, especially viols, were popular; and reed instruments such as shawms, the ancestors of modern woodwinds, were often heard. In addition, the harpsichord established itself at the heart of much instrumental music-making -- it would keep this central role through the next period, the Baroque era.</p> <p> The Baroque era (approximately 1600-1750) produced highly ornate music and established some of the major musical forms, such as the concerto, sonata, and opera. This was the time of major composers such as Monteverdi, Bach, Handel, and Vivaldi. The period saw the establishment of the strings (especially the violins) as the foundation of the orchestra, and the improvement of woodwind instruments such as the flute, oboe, and bassoon, so that orchestras made up of strings plus woodwind became common. The harpsichord kept its place both as a solo instrument and within the orchestra, but in the later part of the period the piano was developed and began to inspire composers to produce increasingly expressive keyboard music.</p> <p> By the time of the Classical period (c.1750-1820), composers such as Haydn, Mozart, and Beethoven were writing symphonies, concertos, and other works for an orchestra with strings, horns, oboes, and bassoons. They often used additional wind instruments such as clarinets, trumpets, and trombones. They began to incorporate further percussion instruments, adding the bass drum, triangle, and cymbals to the orchestra, especially when they wanted to produce exotic musical effects. The Classical composers were also the first to exploit fully the expressive potential of the piano, which developed quickly during this period.</p> <p> The piano was also a key instrument for the composers of the Romantic era (roughly 1820-1910). During this period, composers sought to extend the power and scope of the orchestra still further.

Yet gender and sexual diversity were anything but rare in nonmetropolitan areas in the first half of the twentieth century. Just Queer Folks explores the seldom-discussed history of same-sex intimacy and gender nonconformity in rural and small-town America during a period when the now familiar concepts of heterosexuality and homosexuality were only just beginning to take shape. Eschewing the notion that identity is always the best measure of what can be known about gender and sexuality, Colin R. Johnson argues instead for a queer historicist approach. In so doing, he uncovers a startlingly unruly rural past in which small-town eccentrics, &#34;mannish&#34; farm women, and cross-dressing Civilian Conservation Corps enrolees were often just queer folks so far as their neighbours were concerned. Written with wit and verve, Just Queer Folks upsets a whole host of contemporary commonplaces, including the notion that queer history is always urban history. Colin R. Johnson is Associate Professor of Gender Studies and Adjunct Associate Professor of American Studies, History, and Human Biology at Indiana University, Bloomington.</p><p><b>Colin R. Johnson</b> is Associate Professor of Gender Studies and Adjunct Associate Professor of American Studies, History, and Human Biology at Indiana University Bloomington."Colin Johnson's pioneering book argues that the way we think about modern lesbian, gay and queer identity forms a kind of "metro-chauvinism"... Just Queer Folks takes the reader on a journey through the non-metropolitan US in the first half of the 20th century, observing how heteronormalisation was imposed on the back roads of the nation by centralised state discourse and the conservative forces of capitalism. Via carefully prepared case study after case study, Johnson shows us how largely poor and working-class men and women lived out their queer diversity in situ, and he argues that small towns and rural communities accommodated eccentricity and often protected "their own". Throughout, he reviews the dominant idea of the queer social by inviting reconsideration of the dynamics of alterity and exclusion, and challenges the preconception that to be queer is to be urban, white and middle class." --- Sally R. Munt, Times Higher Education, September 26th 2013<br><br>"In this splendid book, Johnson teaches us to suspect received wisdom... And dispel the notion that in the first half of the 20th century, same-sex intimacy and gender nonconformity were urban specific... Johnson proves the worth of rigorous, scholarly interdisciplinary research... VERDICT: This complex and original work should be read widely by all readers in its interrelated disciplines." ----Library Journal, September 2013<br><br>"Johnson's Just Queer Folks expands the repertoire of sources available to historians studying American sexuality and, most importantly, convincingly argues that a queer rural history requires greater attention for its contribution to the development of modern sexual identities, as well as resistances to them...

Written by two acknowledged experts in the field, the text is securely based on original written and photographic sources, coupled with a systematic analysis of woven structures.<br>The collapse of the Soviet Union and the consequent opening up of communication and trade between the West and the newly independent Caucasian republics has resulted in the release onto the market of previously little known items, in particular flat-weaves. This development calls for a re-evaluation of the subject of Caucasian weaving, a demand which this book seeks to answer. The authors suggest that utilitarian flat-woven covers and containers - many of them spectacularly graphic and colourful - are the true traditional products of Caucasia's weaving culture. This is a departure from previous books written in the West on Caucasian carpets, which have tended to concentrate either on pile-woven village rugs, or on tribal bags, covers and trappings made by nomads whose traditional range straddled the present political borders between Transcaucasia and northwest Persia.<br>Further light is shed on the subject in the authors' documentation of Caucasian knotted pile rugs, which shows that many examples of the popular types which are often thought to be 'authentic' nineteenth century (or even eighteenth in some cases) village weavings, are in fact part of a well-organised commercial production for the Russian and Western markets, which began in the latter part of the nineteenth century and continued well into the first part of the twentieth.</p><p>Sakhai, a London rug dealer from a family of carpet weavers, shares his expertise on history, identification, and value of oriental carpets in this reasonably priced book. He offers tips on judging materials, dyes, patterns, age, and condition when selecting a carpet to buy. In handy guidebook format he describes different types of carpets, accompanied by color and black-and-white photographs (color photographs not seen). The author discusses value in comparative terms only, so prospective buyers will need to study the market to determine fair prices. Caucasian Carpets &amp; Covers is a scholarly work by the curators who assembled the 1994 exhibit "From Kuba to Kars" at the Textile Museum in Washington, D.C. Their book includes knotted pile rugs from the Caucasus in addition to the materials in that exhibit. The text is detailed and comprehensive, accompanied by maps and photographs, mostly in color. Much of the historical material is from Russian sources available only in the former Soviet Union. Unfortunately, full-page color-detail photographs have no captions, making it necessary for the user to search through the volume for the source photograph to identify the detail.

After centuries of Jewish assimilation and intermarriage in German society, he discovered that eliminating Jews from the rest of the population was more difficult than he'd anticipated. As Bryan Rigg shows in this provocative new study, nowhere was that heinous process more fraught with contradiction and confusion than in the German military.<br><br>Contrary to conventional views, Rigg reveals that a startlingly large number of German military men were classified by the Nazis as Jews or "partial-Jews" (Mischlinge), in the wake of racial laws first enacted in the mid-1930s. Rigg demonstrates that the actual number was much higher than previously thought-perhaps as many as 150,000 men, including decorated veterans and high-ranking officers, even generals and admirals.<br><br>As Rigg fully documents for the first time, a great many of these men did not even consider themselves Jewish and had embraced the military as a way of life and as devoted patriots eager to serve a revived German nation. In turn, they had been embraced by the Wehrmacht, which prior to Hitler had given little thought to the "race" of these men but which was now forced to look deeply into the ancestry of its soldiers.<br><br>The process of investigation and removal, however, was marred by a highly inconsistent application of Nazi law. Numerous "exemptions" were made in order to allow a soldier to stay within the ranks or to spare a soldier's parent, spouse, or other relative from incarceration or far worse. (Hitler's own signature can be found on many of these "exemption" orders.) But as the war dragged on, Nazi politics came to trump military logic, even in the face of the Wehrmacht's growing manpower needs, closing legal loopholes and making it virtually impossible for these soldiers to escape the fate of millions of other victims of the Third Reich.<br><br>Based on a deep and wide-ranging research in archival and secondary sources, as well as extensive interviews with more than four hundred Mischlinge and their relatives, Rigg's study breaks truly new ground in a crowded field and shows from yet another angle the extremely flawed, dishonest, demeaning, and tragic essence of Hitler's rule.</p><p>Working in newly opened archives and reexamining old evidence, historian Bryan Mark Rigg turns up a surprising wrinkle in the history of Nazi Germany: the presence of part-Jewish soldiers not only in the ranks but also in the upper echelons of the German military. One such soldier recalled, "I served because I wanted to prove Hitler's racial nonsense wrong. I wanted to prove that people of Jewish descent were indeed brave and courageous soldiers." By Rigg's estimate, as many as 150,000 soldiers, sailors, and airmen of partial Jewish descent (<i>Mischlinge</i>, in Nazi terminology) served in Adolf Hitler's forces--some, such as field marshal and war criminal Erhard Milch, placed in high positions by Hitler himself even as he tightened the noose on the Jews of Europe. Rigg considers the role of these men as they negotiated the confusion of the monolithic, racist state in dealing with Germans of partial Jewish descent. "[Their] experience clearly demonstrates the complexity of life in the Third Reich," writes Rigg. His book sheds light on a difficult subject in the face of certain controversy, and it merits discussion. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i>"Through videotaped interviews, painstaking attention to personnel files, and banal documents not normally consulted by historians, and spurred by a keen sense of personal mission, Rigg has turned up an unexplored and confounding chapter in the history of the Holocaust. The extent of his findings has surprised scholars."--Warren Hoge, <i>New York Times</i> <p>"The revelation that Germans of Jewish blood, knowing the Nazi regime for what it was, served Hitler as uniformed members of his armed forces must come as a profound shock. It will surprise even professional historians of the Nazi years." --John Keegan, author of <i>The Face of Battle</i> and <i>The Second World War</i> </p><p>"Startling and unexpected, Rigg's study conclusively demonstrates the degree of flexibility in German policy toward the Mischlinge, the extent of Hitler's involvement, and, most importantly, that not all who served in the armed forces were anti-Semitic, even as their service aided the killing process."--Michael Berenbaum, author of <i>The World Must Know: The History of the Holocaust</i> </p><p>"Rigg's extensive knowledge and the preliminary conclusions drawn from his research impressed me greatly. I firmly believe that his in-depth treatment of the subject of German soldiers of Jewish descent in the Wehrmacht will lead to new perspectives on this portion of 20th century German military history."--Helmut Schmidt, Former Chancellor of Germany </p><p>"An impressively researched work with important implications for hotly debated questions.

What it lacks compared with the enormous power of the weather, an earthquake, or a volcano, it makes up for in romance -- a small bird pits its wits against the elements and accomplishes, as routine, a journey that is truly superhuman. Outlandish theories have been proposed to explain the seasonal ebb and flow of bird populations, including that the birds went to the moon, were transformed into other species, or spent the winter in the mud of lakes or ponds. The knowledge of what really happens is, in many ways, no less fantastic. </p><p> Over the centuries, people have struggled to understand birds' migrations and how they manage them year after year. How can they fly such tremendous distances without becoming lost or so exhausted that they die? How have today's complex migration patterns evolved from what were once, presumably, simple movements? And what particular problems are migratory birds facing now and are they coping? Although many parts of the mystery have been unraveled, there is still much that remains to be discovered about this fascinating phenomenon. </p></p><h2>Evidence Bible-OE-KJV Comfortable Version</h2><p><p>(Burgundy leather)</p> <p></p> <p>Reveal the absurdity of evolution.

The poems in her new collection, <i>Holy Heathen Rhapsody</i>, embrace and embody the forces of the Earth and the creative power of its lifeforms in all the wildness of their varieties. Love in these poems is a force infused with the same creative power and intensity, the purest manifestation of the will-to-be. This vision and its making contend that even a shadow or a floating seed, a frond of green or a midnight spider, even a mongrel dog, wind over water, the human voice, the human witness, peace and weapons, all&#x2014;every aspect and feature encountered&#x2014;are fully endowed players in the dynamic music of the Earth.</p><p>Pattiann Rogers has published fourteen books of poetry; two book-length essay collections, <i>The Dream of the Marsh Wren</i> and <i>The Grand Array</i>; and <i>A Covenant of Seasons</i>, poems and monotypes, in collaboration with Joellyn Duesberry.&nbsp; She is the recipient of two NEA grants, a Guggenheim Fellowship, and a Lannan Literary Award for poetry.&nbsp; In 2018 she was awarded the John Burroughs Medal for Lifetime Achievement in Nature Poetry.&nbsp; She lives in Colorado.<b>Praise for <i>Holy Heathen Rhapsody</i><br><br></b>&#x201c;An impassioned, carefully conceived collection that reaffirms Rogers&#x2019;s long-standing devotion to poetry about the natural world . . . Precise details ground the poems and show Rogers to be a rigorous observer.&nbsp; With great craft and care, she presents her apprehensions of the natural world with striking accuracy and emotional impact . . . this buoyant collection nudges us to think ourselves closer into nature, acknowledging a more blended, intertwined mass.&#x201d;<b> &#x2013; Lisa Williams, </b><i><b>Orion</b><br></i><br> &#x201c;Rogers&#x2019;s poems inspire a feeling of transcendence in using language to create a riotous sense of abandon and a joyous pleasure upon experiencing blooming, burgeoning nature at all sides . . . [they] propose a mechanism to rediscover an essential, compassionate regard of self and nature.&#x201d; <b>&#x2013; <i>World Literature Today</i><br><br>Praise for Pattiann Rogers:</b><br><br>&#x201c;If only one word could be used to describe Rogers&#x2019; poetry, it would have to be <i>cosmic</i> because her ravishing lyrical and imaginative poems embrace the vastness and interlocking wonders of the universe. Rogers&#x2019; newest collection is positively stellar in its radiant beauty, fractal patterning, and uplifting vision of life&#x2019;s unity... By turns metaphysician and naturalist, spiritual pilgrim and trickster, Rogers writes with grand precision about weather, animals, plants, and landscape.&#x201d;<br><b>&#x2014;Donna Seaman, <i>ALA Booklist</i>, on <i>Generations</i> (2004)</b><br><br>&#x201c;Rogers celebrates and embraces the physical, sensual world&#x2014;its plentitude, fecundity, voluptuousness, and variety&#x2014;the gross and rank as well as the most exquisite beauty.... For the intense fusing of thought and feeling, along with the juxtapositions of wit, the erotic, and the spiritual questing, which are characteristic of her work, one would have to go back to the English metaphysical poets.&#x201d;<br><b>&#x2014;Robert Buttel</b><br><br>&#x201c;If angels were to agree upon a language to describe creation, a tone of voice and a point of view that would adequately celebrate the divine, these would be the poems they would write. In language that is precise and accurate, with a tenacious heart and a penetrating eye, Pattiann Rogers beatifies. She exposes the dizzying dimensions of earthly space and incants the swoon of physical love. If this is not poetry in service to humanity, I do not know what it is.&#x201d;<br><b>&#x2014;Barry Lopez</b><br><br>&#x201c;I believe Pattiann Rogers walks the world at night when we are sleeping. Her poems are translations of our dreaming life&#x2014;what we know to be true but fail to remember. We read her words, sentence by sentence, image by image, and return to all that is beautiful, mysterious, and erotic.&#x201d;<br><b>&#x2014;Terry Tempest Williams</b><br><br>&#x201c;Pattiann Rogers is a visionary of reality, perceiving the material world with such intensity of response that impulse, intention, meaning, interconnections beyond the skin of appearance are revealed. Her language, unmarred by clich�s, springs up out of a sense of how various and endlessly amazing are the forms of life and the human ability to notice them.&#x201d;<br><b>&#x2014;Denise Levertov</b><br><br>&#x201c;How the densely detailed, thickly textured, imaged stanzas of Pattiann Rogers result in so much light-as-air wonderment is surely one of the greater questions&#x2014;one of the greater magics&#x2014;of contemporary poetry. But however it happens, we must be thankful&#x2014;for both the science text and the psalter of her work, for both the physical abundance and for the spirit flimmering over it.&#x201d;<br><b>&#x2014;Albert Goldbarth</b></p><h2>The Georgia Catalog: Historic American Buildings Survey.

Thousands of <em>peshmerga</em> (Kurdish guerrillas) responded, seizing the towns and countryside of northern Iraq. But after Saddam signed the truce with the U.N. forces, he sent his surviving units north, slaughtering the lightly-armed Kurds and driving millions more into exile while the Allies stood aside. For the Kurds, it was one more betrayal in their long and tragic history.<br> In <em>No Friends but the Mountains</em>, veteran Middle East journalists John Bulloch and Harvey Morris provide the only history of the Kurdish people available today. Ranging from their earliest origins to the aftermath of the Gulf War, Bulloch and Morris trace the course of the Kurds' past and identify the pressures that have denied them a state of their own for so many centuries. Numbering some sixteen million and spread across five countries, the Kurds are the world's largest nationality without a state--a people divided among themselves in their struggle for independence, the pawns of rival governments throughout history. Bulloch and Morris show how they were exploited by the Turks and the Great Powers in the days of the Ottoman Empire, how the British, French, and the new Turkish republic subverted Woodrow Wilson's promise of a Kurdish state in 1918, and how the Kurds' revolts and insurrections led to further repression. Later the <em>peshmerga</em> guerrillas were funded and manipulated by Saddam Hussein, the Shah of Iran, Israel, and the CIA--while the Turkish government has harshly repressed any signs of Kurdish identity, banning the use of the Kurdish language until only recently. Both Saddam and Khomeini's government sought to use the Kurds to their own advantage during the long Iran-Iraq War. Bulloch and Morris trace the history of the main Kurdish organizations, such as the PKK in Turkey and the KDP in Iraq, underscoring the divisions that are threatening Kurdish survival at a time when the Iraqi army stands poised to attack the "safe haven" established by the U.N.<br> This authoritative, highly readable account details the story of the rebellion, exile, and return that followed the Gulf War, providing a critical historical perspective on these momentous events. Written by two leading Middle East journalists, <em>No Friends But the Mountains</em> offers the first history of the long-suffering people at the center of one of the world's most explosive conflicts.</p><p><br><em>About the Authors:</em><br> <strong>John Bulloch</strong> has been diplomatic correspondent of the BBC World Service, Middle East correspondent for the <em>Daily Telegraph</em>, Middle East editor of the <em>Independent</em>, and diplomatic editor of the <em>Independent on Sunday</em>. <strong>Harvey Morris</strong> was chief correspondent for Reuters in Tehran and Beirut and is deputy foreign editor for the <em>Independent</em>. Bulloch and Morris wrote <em>The Gulf War: The History of the Iran-Iraq Conflict</em> and <em>Saddam's War</em>.<br>Numbering more than 20 million, the Kurds--the world's largest minority without a state--live in an area the size of France, united by a common culture and a distinct language but divided by the frontiers of Iran, Iraq, Turkey, Lebanon and Russia. When the Kurds of Iraq rebelled against Saddam Hussein during the Gulf war, they were led to expect aid from the West; but Saddam launched a campaign of vengeance that included unrestrained use of chemical weapons while the international community looked on in virtual silence. In this well-researched, accessible study, Bullock and Morris, coauthors of Saddam's War , show how--but not why--Kurdish history has been dominated since antiquity by political betrayal and that the Kurds have often been victims of their own squabbles. The closest the disputatious tribespeople have come to a unified action, according to the authors, was during the Iran-Iraq war of the 1980s when the Kurds of Turkey, Iran and Iraq rose up briefly against the governing powers. Nor is a pan-Kurdish political movement likely, they add, in the foreseeable future.

She has twelve albums, has had numerous gallery shows, and continues to give concerts of her music and poetry. Her books include Early Work, The Coral Sea, Witt, Babel, Auguries of Innocence, Woolgathering, Land 250, Trois, and many others. She lives in New York.The revival of interest in 1970s punk culture reaches an apotheosis with this strong selection of poems, prose and assorted rantings from Smith, who as a writer and musician embodied the New York downtown punk-rock ethos in its most romantic, naive and optimistic form. She first came to prominence with the publication of the slim but powerful Seventh Heaven and Witt , which blazed with post-Beat poetics, rock-and-roll rhythms and an aggressive sexuality that celebrated yet tried to transcend feminine stereotypes. "I'm cool as menthol," Smith bragged. "I keep trying to figure out what it means / to be american." In fact, she often descended into excess--"blushing monument: pink sphinx.sizzling / squirrel.fallen / pharaoh"--but kept her head: "we long for what we cannot love / to be freed from the boundaries / of our terrible skin." Though her first poems still burn, the collection is most revealing as an account of Smith's transition from poetry into the world of rock, showing her movement from verse to prose; from the influence of Ginsberg to Burroughs; from a sense of personal rebellion to public spectacle; and finally to a tone of resignation in her late-'70s poems. Smith's assessment of poet-rocker Jim Morrison might also apply to her own book: "Today the drama of his intensity seems dated. Dated in its passion and innocence." Still, her claim that she "reinvented frenzy" is correct--without Smith there would have been no Karen Finley, no Kathy Acker.

As Stephen Shore has written, Our country is made for long trips. Since the 1940s, the dream of the road trip, and the sense of possibility and freedom that it represents, has taken its own important place within our culture. Many photographers purposefully embarked on journeys across the U.S. in order to create work, including Robert Frank, whose seminal road trip resulted in <i>The Americans.</i> However, he was preceded by Edward Weston, who traveled across the country taking pictures to illustrate Walt Whitman's <i>Leaves of Grass</i>; Henri Cartier-Bresson, whose 1947 trip through the American South and into the West was published in the early 1950s in <i>Harper's Bazaar</i>; and Ed Ruscha, whose road trips between Los Angeles and Oklahoma formed the basis of <i>Twentysix Gasoline Stations.</i> Hundreds of photographers have continued the tradition of the photographic road trip on down to the present, from Stephen Shore to Taiyo Onorato, Nico Krebs, Alec Soth and Ryan McGinley. <i>The Open Road</i> considers the photographic road trip as a genre in and of itself, and presents the story of photographers for whom the American road is muse. The book features David Campany's introduction to the genre and 18 chapters presented chronologically, each exploring one American road trip in depth through a portfolio of images and informative texts. This volume highlights some of the most important bodies of work made on the road, from <i>The Americans</i> to the present day.</p><p>Historian David Campany is one of the best-known and most accessible writers on photography. He has published several books, among them Handful of Dust (2015), The Open Road: Photography and the American Road Trip (Aperture, 2014), Walker Evans: The Magazine Work (2013), and Photography and Cinema (2008). He contributes regularly to a range of publications, including Aperture and Oxford Art Journal.David Campany&#x2019;s study of the great photographic odysseys across America reveals a country more diverse than ever. &#x2013;<i>The Guardian</i><br>David Campany compiles a photographic boulevard of broken dreams running from the Swiss immigrant&nbsp;Robert Frank&#x2019;s nomadic portraits of 1950s stragglers to the sinister 21st century manipulations of the team Taiyo Onorato and Nico Krebs, who document roads that exist only in some collective hallucination. &#x2013;<i>The New York Times LENS</i> blog<br>The vastness is also erotic&#x2014;it&#x2019;s a void urban photographers and their subjects can disappear into. &#x2013;<i>The New York Times LENS </i>blog<br>By the end, you'll feel as if you've been in the passenger seat for a page-by-page road trip of a lifetime. &#x2013;<i>Los Angeles Times</i><br>From shots of Mount Rushmore and the Pacific Coast Highway to glimpses of everyday life at roadside motels and pit stops, the photos highlight Americans&#x2019; long-standing fascination with the road, as a window into both the country&#x2019;s cultural life&#x2014;with the car window as a literal frame&#x2014;and its pioneering attitude. &#x2013; <i>The Wall Street Journal</i></p><h2>Murder in the Pleasure Gardens (Beau Brummell Mysteries)</h2><p>In the days of Regency England, Beau Brummell stood as the uncrowned king of genteel Society. Whatever he wore was the height of fashion. Wherever he went was the place to be seen. And the last place one would expect to find him was in the middle of a murder mystery.<br>After one too many distasteful meals at his usual gentleman's club, Beau Brummell opens his own named Watier's. It isn't long before the club's exquisite cuisine and high gambling stakes attract London's aristocracy to Beau's doors. But the fashionable establishment becomes embroiled in scandal when Lieutenant Nevill, inexperienced in games of change, believes he's been cheated at cards by government official Theobald Jacombe. The confrontation escalates when Jacombe makes off-color remarks about the lieutenant's intended...infuriating the young officer into challenging him to a duel.<br>Before Beau can talk Nevill out of this course of action, Jacombe is found murdered at Vauxhall's Pleasure Gardens - and the lieutenant is detained as the most likely suspect. Convinced of Nevill's innocence, the master of style must deduce who would want to kill a respected member of the Home Office with a supposedly spotless reputation.</p><p>Rosemary Stevens lives outside Richmond, Virginia, with her husband and two children. She has published several novels set in Regency England. She is also the author of <b>Death on a Silver Tray</b>, the first Beau Brummell mystery.Agatha Award winner Stevens's latest recounting of Beau Brummell's sleuthing activities (after 2002's The Bloodied Cravat) bears signs of being executed in haste, and executed in haste is just what the Beau's friend, Lieutenant Nevill, will be if the Regency's "Arbiter of Fashion" doesn't find the real killer of Thomas Jacombe, "trusted friend of Earl Spencer and a long-time official in the Home Office." At Watier's Club one evening, Nevill accuses Jacombe of cheating at cards, and Brummell agrees to serve as second for the duel the two men agree to. But the night before the duel, Jacombe's body tumbles over the Grand Cascade at Vauxhall, ruining the Prince of Wales's gala. Spotted with a gun in his hand, Nevill is promptly arrested. Brummell, however, knows that Nevill's accusation of false play was well founded. In his search for other suspects, Brummell discovers that the seemingly upright Jacombe had wronged many people besides the young lieutenant, of whom the Beau is very fond. Exactly why he's fond of Nevill is hard to judge, because only the Beau, as narrator, has any character at all. Poorly drawn secondary characters, a contrived plot and an unlikely denouement-it's hard to imagine the murderer caring enough about anything to do Jacombe in-mar this effort. A wonderful description of the Grand Cascade at Vauxhall serves to remind readers that Stevens, the author of several Regencies (Crime of Manners, etc.), is capable of better. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Opening the Dragon Gate: The Making of a Modern Taoist Wizard</h2><p>Opening the Dragon Gate is the authorized biography of Wang Liping (1949- ), a modern Taoist wizard.

But in fact, such a collaboration turns out to be a formula for great success, when the right artist is given the reins. Jeff Koons managed it in 2008, and in 2010, Japanese Pop impresario Takashi Murakami rose to the challenge. In a grand hall sporting a vaulted ceiling thick with paint and gold stands a snowman like construction, stacked spheres of grinning Technicolor flowers that sprouted gleeful tentacles and antennae, while a blonde manga minx in a near-pornographic maid's costume offers an exuberant gesture of welcome. This is "my Versailles, manga style," Murakami declares, throwing down the gauntlet to those who would preserve Versailles from such glorious and fantastical encounters; "I am the Cheshire cat that welcomes Alice in Wonderland with its diabolic smile, and chatters away as she wanders around the Ch�teau." Across 125 color plates, this magnificent volume documents the show's22 works, which included seven new sculptures never before exhibited.<br><b>Takashi Murakami</b> was born in Tokyo in 1963. Having studied traditional arts such as Nihonga, he quickly found ways to update their imagery through Japan's burgeoning "otaku" (geek) culture of manga and anime. Murakami's "Superflat" style and emphasis on readily grasp able imagery with an edge has led to a Warhol-esque production plant generating t-shirts, key chains and plush dolls alongside painting and sculpture. He has also collaborated with Marc Jacobs, Louis Vuitton and Kanye West. In 2008 Murakami was named one of Time magazine's"100 Most Influential People," and was the only artist to make the list.</p><p></p><h2>Ball Pythons in Captivity (Professional Breeders Series)</h2><p>Provides information on Ball Pythons in nature and in captivity, diet, selection, health concerns, breeding and egg incubation, and basic knowledge of your ball python. 114 full-color photographs.</p><p></p><h2>Cat on a Hyacinth Hunt: A Midnight Louie Mystery (Midnight Louie Mysteries)</h2><p>Back in Las Vegas after a holiday trip to the big apple, feline detective Midnight Louie witnesses death on the Nile when the battling Egyptian barges outside the Oasis hotel bring a dead body to the surface.

(Although her five-alarm-fire-red hair should have tipped her off to that likelihood long before now.)<br>Today, on her return home, she was discovering how hard it was to scurry anonymously through the vast, gleaming Las Vegas airport while toting a twenty-pound black cat in a purple knapsack affixed like a baby-carrier to her d�colletage.<br>Temple had no d�colletage worth noticing at the moment (or any other moment, in her modest opinion), just Midnight Louie hanging limp as a sack of couch potatoes front and center. If anybody tried to shoot her, she'd be more protected by feline flab and fur than by Kevlar body armor.<br>Of course, no one (that she knew of) wanted to shoot her at the moment, but someone might be hoping to spot her. She didn't want to see anything but the Whittlesea Blue cab that would whisk her home to the Circle Ritz.<br>No surprises, she thought, dragging her rolling luggage behind her through the hectic between-holiday crowds that besiege the Slot-machine City over Christmas and New Year's.<br>No Electra Lark checking the plane schedule Temple had left with her, then deciding to drop by McCarran Airport and pick up her returning tenant on some good-Samaritan whim.<br>No Matt Devine playing Boy Scout gallant.

She stopped and turned, stricken.<br>Oh. Only Crawford Buchanan, the slime reporter. To think that she would ever be <i>relieved</i> to see <i>him</i>. His brown distressed-leather jacket had to have escaped a J. Peterman catalog, along with an ivory silk aviator scarf that dangled almost to his knees and would look infinitely better on either gentleman of her acquaintance that she was so intent on avoiding at the moment.<br>"Well. If it isn't the Munchkin Hunchfront of Notre Dame," Crawford went on, as he was always going on, his conceited drawl emphasizing his one good attribute, a deep, thrilling, radio-mike voice. "Does that cat ring bells in his spare time? He certainly does nothing for your figure."<br>"Louie and I are both too travel-worn for chitchat. What are you doing here? You don't look like you're heading in or out. No baggage."<br>"Elementary deduction, my dear Watsonette. I'm here to pick up my squeeze. Her and her kid visited family for the holidays."<br>"I loathe the expression 'squeeze.' "<br>"Too bad. It's here to stay, T.B. Just like me." He leered.<br>Crawford Buchanan was the only man outside of a silent movie melodrama who still knew how to leer.<br>Temple turned and resumed her race for the airport exit. "Tell it to the marines. I have a feeling they could fix that."<br>A Whittlesea Blue cab was waiting. Several were. Temple took the first one and collapsed into the backseat. The ride from McCarran airport was almost laughable. Seen from the runways, Las Vegas Strip landmark hotel-casinos made a crazy-quilt skyline: the Luxor's pointed pyramid jousted with the fools-cap Disney-blue towers of the Camelot, which tilted at the new New York-New York's boxy art deco skyscrapers, which contrasted with the Mirage's tidal-wave wall of gilded glass.<br>Entering Las Vegas was like driving into a town of half-scale architects' models, a <i>Twilight Zone</i> set that even Rod Serling could never have imagined in quite this unlikely juxtaposition.<br>Temple and Louie were deposited before the Circle Ritz's round fifties silhouette in no time flat, for an absurdly low fare.<br>She had asked the cab driver to drop them at the wedding chapel in front. Not that she was expecting imminent nuptials, but this way she could sneak in the attached apartment building's side entrance, avoiding the back entry via the parking lot and the pool, where she was likely to confront the Ritz's usual suspects.<br>In the deserted marble-lined lobby she pushed the elevator button, glad to have only one elevator to deal with and only four floors of building ahead of her, after her sojourn in high-rise New York-New York, the Original.<br>The elevator doors opened, revealing...nobody. Temple darted in like a daylight robber, cussing when her wheeled baggage rollers caught in the brass-edged gap between lobby and car. She wrestled her key out from her tote bag during the one-floor journey and clenched it between her teeth for safekeeping while both hands were busy dragging baggage.<br>The thick hall carpeting nearly derailed her bags, but she finally turned down the cul-de-sac leading to her front door.<br>There she leaned the bags against the wall, reclaimed the moist key and unlocked her door. Solid mahogany heft drew it open of its own accord. Sighing at this small boon, she stepped over the threshold.<br>She broke through an invisible skin of her own absence, encountering the undisturbed peace of rooms abandoned for a while. Everything in its place, including silence, and a blessed familiarity. The effacing hum of the refrigerator. The place even looked neater than she had remembered leaving it, but that was just the Alzheimer's effect of being away kicking in.<br>She unhooked Louie's CatAboard Seat, letting him and it ease to the floor.<br>He was out and sniffing around like a bloodhound, then edging out of sight. She heard a muted thump atop the kitchen counter as she wrestled the luggage inside.<br>A sense of d�j� vu subdued her like an opiate as she warily moved through each room, hunting nameless snares and traps. She entered her own bedroom like a thief, expecting another's spoor. Nothing but her own imagination and some hallucinogenic fragrance. Being'away always brought her back a temporary foreigner attuned to smells and sights residence had made unde-tectable.<br>Too weary to unpack, she tilted her luggage against a bedroom wall before returning to the main room to lock the front door. Then she rooted through the cupboards for something succulent to spoon over the eternal mound of dry Free-to-be-Feline pellets occupying Louie's dish like one of those lifelike ceramic desserts restaurants parade before jaded diners' palates nowadays.<br>The cat thumped down from somewhere in the living room and came running for smoked oysters in shrimp sauce. Temple collected and folded his--<i>her</i>--carry-pouch and tucked it away in the tiny guest closet. She returned to the kitchen, wondering what she should do. Eat. Rest. Or sit down and stare at the walls. Someone Knocked at her door.<br>Temple's jump made Louie look up resentfully from his eating.<br>The knock had not only startled Temple but it had interrupted the total concentration Midnight Louie required for dining.<br>Heart pounding for no good reason, Temple went to open her door without peeking through the tiny peephole. She had to face the music some time, no matter who was playing what instrument.<br>"Electra!"<br>"I heard your cab arrive and thought you might want your mail." Her landlady hefted a cardboard box overflowing with rolled-up newspapers, mail-order catalogs, bills, solicitations and Christmas cards.<br>"Thanks. I think. Did you have a nice holiday?"<br>"Great. A couple of the kids got to town, only one with grandchildren. And you?"<br>"Interesting."<br>"Oh?" Electra, clad in a seasonal muumuu whose pattern somehow blended orchids and evergreens, paused after depositing the box of mail on Temple's coffee table, awaiting a report.<br>"Sit down," Temple said, capitulating. Of all the people she might have encountered immediately on returning home, Electra was the least harrowing. "Want something to drink?"<br>"Nope. Eggnogged, wined and Mimosa-ed my way through too many meals out while the kids were in town. I'll just get a load off my feet-and it's more load than before you left-then settle next to my pal Louie. Oof! He's got oyster breath."<br>Electra's weight not only dimpled the love-seat cushion, but caused Louie to roll right into her evergreen orchid patch. Too rotund himself to fight gravity, they stayed hip to hip and floral print to fur. Louie even began to purr.<br>"Aw, he missed me. My little big boy. Well? Did you two win the commercial contract?"<br>"Don't know. We didn't exactly endear ourselves to the advertising agency. I managed to implicate a murderer among them."<br>Electra clapped her hands until the copper, silver and brass bangles on each wrist jangled. "Some people would be so greedy for their own advancement that they'd rather conceal than reveal such a thing. I'm sure your integrity made a big impression on them."<br>"Integrity is not the desirable commodity it used to be. And concealing things isn't as easy as it sounds," Temple answered grimly.<br>"Is there something I should know?"<br>Temple paused, rubbing her...temple. "No, but there's something I should know. Is Matt back yet?"<br>"Last evening, just in time to rush to his job at ConTact. But he seemed in a peach of a mood. Must have had a good Christmas visit home in Chicago. Poor guy. He was moping around after you left for New York."<br>"Not merely over my departure!"<br>"Well--," Electra, a card-carrying justice of the peace, seemed to toy with a temptation to fan the flames of like into the ashes of true romance. "No. He seemed to have a lot on his mind. But you were definitely in there."<br>"I think I know why." Temple grinned. "Have you been inside his place recently?"<br>"Me? No. I do not snoop when tenants are off the premises. Although, now that you mention it, I heard a lot of strange thumps from his apartment. Almost sounded like a body being dragged around."<br>Temple nodded sagely. "A dead weight indeed. I persuaded him to invest in a flashy vintage sofa before I left. It must have found its way home."<br>"Flashy? Matt? That doesn't sound right. He's such a dear boy and I love him to death....really, I mean that, though not literally, given your track record with corpses-but sometimes he seems rather naive and a little staid."<br>"No law against that," Temple said rather briskly. "Sometimes I feel rather naive myself."<br>"And you all of what-? Thirty?"<br>"Don't mock me, Electra. Between my recent immersion in murder, among other things, I'm aging rapidly."<br>"You do look a little peaked."<br>"Electra, nobody's called me 'peaked' since I was in high school and my mother was on my case."<br>"Thank you," she said complacently, patting Louie. The cat stretched as long as a yardstick and kneaded his claws against a particularly lurid orchid on Electra's knee.<br>"Ouch!" she complained. "Cut that out! His claws are sharper than needle-nosed pliers."<br>"He hasn't been able to run around nights and use them. He was strictly a lap cat in New York City."<br>"Lap of luxury," Electra said fondly, scratching Louie's chin while he stretched his head back and slitted his eyes. "It's really nice that you found each other," she added.<br>"Huh?" Temple was having a panic attack, wondering if Electra were as psychic as she claimed her cat Karma was.<br>But she hadn't detected memories of Max floating among Temple's conflicting thoughts; she was speaking of the current resident male, Midnight Louie.<br>"He's a great companion," she went on.<br>"I don't know. He runs around a lot nights and comes in at ungodly hours expecting to be petted and pampered, and usually fed."<br>"It's a good thing you're solo these days--and nights--though."<br>"What do you mean?"<br>"Louie doesn't strike me as the type to share."<br>"Louie doesn;t own me. I didn't promise to forsake all others when he tripped into my life at the convention center. Actually, he tripped me quite literally."<br>"Such a rapscallion." Electra tickled Louie's considerable tummy while he rolled under the attention. "Call me a hopeless romantic, but I can't resist these devil-may-care boys in black."<br>Temple refrained from adding, "Me too."<br>* * *<br>After Electra had left, Temple sat on the couch idly sorting her mail into intimidating stacks without reading it. Usually she loved diving into a motherlode of hoarded vacation mail, especially when it included notes from distant friends.<br>"I must be tired," she told Louie, who certainly had the part down pat himself.<br>The big tomcat sprawled upon his back as languid as Adam on the Sistine Chapel ceiling. Temple doubted that even God's lightning bolt could move him. His lazily curled limbs pointed to Temple's intriguingly vaulted white ceiling on which the Las Vegas sunlight played chiaroscuro peekaboo with indoor shadows. One of his back feet was particularly elevated; when he assumed this lounging lion position, Temple always felt she should extend immediate permission for him to leave the classroom to go to the little boys room.<br>Louie yawned, a major production that revealed a pallid rose blooming on his otherwise black palate.<br>"It's called a 'letdown,' " Temple told him, dramatically driving her Mexican onyx dagger through another envelope and creating a jagged edge. "Like when actors finish the run of a play, or a PR woman is done with a big publicity campaign or a cat no longer is the toast of Madison Avenue."<br>Louie blinked. Feline body language always struck Temple as inherently foreign, like a Parisian shrug or an eloquently obscene Italian hand gesture. When a cat blinks, one senses one is being paid a profoundly flattering attention as has not been offered the human kind since Eden. Like Italian sign language, the feline dialect had its ruder side as well, but today Louie was luxuriating. Temple flattered herself further that he not only was attentive to her every thought and mood, but that he was glad to be home.<br>She sat back and closed her eyes, like Louie.<br><i>Letdown</i>. Like when a woman has resumed a romantic liaison without knowing <i>why</i>, or <i>when</i> again or <i>where</i> again or <i>wherefore art thou, Romeo?</i> Max had called her three times at Kit's after leaving New York so suddenly, so literally anticlimactically. So Maximumly.<br>As usual, he couldn't discuss over the telephone any particulars for his midnight call back to Las Vegas, and in Kit's airy but intimate rooms, Temple couldn't murmur anything but inanities against the background noise of her aunt's pointed attempts to pretend she was too busy elsewhere in the apartment to hear Temple's half of the conversation.<br>Temple couldn't forget waking up in the hotel whose name she hadn't bothered to remember that post-Chr...</p><h2>Twentieth Century Pleasures: Prose on Poetry</h2><p><p>U.S. Poet Laureate Robert Hass considers some of the twentiethcentury poets who bring him pleasure: Robert Lowll, JamesWright, Tomas Transtromer, Joseph Brodsky, Yvor Winters,Robert Creeley, James McMichael, Czeslaw Milosz, and others,in this, his first collection of essays.

Unfortunately for me, I&#x2019;m the latter. Even though I&#x2019;m around hot football players every afternoon, they are not allowed to date me. If they even come close to flirting, my dad, Coach &#x201c;The Boss&#x201d; Davis, makes them run laps around the field until they puke. Nothing scares off a boy more than the threat of physical pain. Not only has he forbidden me to date anyone at all, he&#x2019;s even made me the football team&#x2019;s water girl so that he can keep tabs on me. Apparently, over protective dad is a fabulous guy deterrent. Outdoor shops should find a way to bottle it and sell it. They&#x2019;d make a killing.What Dad doesn&#x2019;t know is that I spend every last second of those two blissful hours of practice in the scorching California heat, starting at Tyson Blake. He is the epitome of perfection in a six-foot-two, incredibly toned, smells-good-even-when-he-sweats, senior body. And when he smiles, angels sing. Literally. And Dad hates him.It feels a bit cliche to say I fell for the one guy that would send Dad&#x2019;s already high blood pressure over the the top. But it&#x2019;s true. There&#x2019;s something about Tyson. Something he&#x2019;s trying to hide.

Many consider his talent a gift; Johnny feels cursed. His fianc�e married another man during his coma and people clamor for him to solve their problems.<br> <br> When Johnny has a disturbing vision after he shakes the hand of an ambitious and amoral politician, he must decide if he should take drastic action to change the future. With &#x201c;powerful tension that holds the reader to the story like a pin to a magnet&#x201d; (<i>The Houston Post</i>), <i>The Dead Zone</i> is a &#x201c;faultlessly paced...continuously engrossing&#x201d; (<i>Los Angeles Times</i>) novel of second sight.</p><p>In the <i>St. James Guide to Horror, Ghost &amp; Gothic Writers</i>, Gary Westfahl predicts that "King has already earned himself a place in the history of literature.... At the very least, he will enjoy the status of a latter-day Anthony Trollope, an author respected for his popularity and social commentary.... More likely, he will be enshrined as the Charles Dickens of the late 20th century, the writer who perfectly reflected, encapsulated, and expressed the characteristic concerns of his era." <p> If any of King's novels exemplifies his skill at portraying the concerns of his generation, it's <i>The Dead Zone</i> (1979). Although it contains a horrific subplot about a serial killer, it isn't strictly a horror novel. It's the story of an unassuming high school teacher, an Everyman, who suffers a gap in time--like a Rip Van Winkle who blacks out during the years 1970-75--and thus becomes acutely conscious of the way that American society is rapidly changing. He wakes up as well with a gap in his brain, the "dead zone" of the title. The zone gives him crippling headaches, but also grants him second sight, a talent he doesn't want and is reluctant to use. The crux of the novel concerns whether he will use that talent to alter the course of history.</p><p> <i>The Dead Zone</i> is a tight, well-crafted book. When asked in 1983 which of his novels so far was "the best," Stephen King answered, "The one that I think works the best is <i>Dead Zone</i>. It's the one that [has] the most story." <i>--Fiona Webster</i></p>Stephen King is the author of more than sixty books, all of them worldwide bestsellers.&nbsp;His recent work includes&nbsp;<i>The Institute</i>, <i>Elevation</i>, <i>The Outsider</i>,&nbsp;<i>Sleeping Beauties</i>&nbsp;(cowritten with his son Owen King), and the Bill Hodges trilogy:&nbsp;<i>End of Watch</i>,&nbsp;<i>Finders&nbsp;Keepers</i>,&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Mr. Mercedes</i>&nbsp;(an Edgar Award winner&nbsp;for Best Novel and an AT&amp;T Audience Network original television series).

Inside is a letter of love and longing to "Catherine," signed simply "Garrett." Challenged by the mystery and pulled by emotions she doesn't fully understand, Theresa begins a search for this man that will change her life. What happens to her is unexpected, perhaps miraculous-an encounter that embraces all our hopes for finding someone special, for having a love that is timeless and everlasting.... Nicholas Sparks exquisitely chronicles the human heart. In his first bestselling novel, The Notebook, he created a testament to romantic love that touched readers around the world. Now in this New York Times bestseller, he renews our faith in destiny, in the ability of lovers to find each other no matter where, no matter when...</p><p>If you thought <i>The Notebook</i> was a tearjerker, get out the hankies, pull up a chair, and get ready to have your heart monkey-wrenched by Nicholas Sparks's second star-crossed love story, <i>Message in a Bottle</i>. When Theresa Osborne takes a much-needed summer holiday at Cape Cod, she finds a lot more than a break from the hustle and bustle. On an early-morning jog along Cape Cod Bay, she comes across a corked bottle with a scrolled-up message inside that reads, "My Dearest Catherine, I miss you, my darling, as I always do, but today is especially hard because the ocean has been singing to me, and the song is that of our life together..." It bobbles around in the same vein for several more paragraphs and ends with "...am alone on the pier and I do not care what others think as I bow my head and cry and cry and cry. Garret." <p> Garret may eat quiche, but no bother--before you can say "Look! I found two more letters!" Theresa is hot on his trail and determined to find this mysterious yet sensitive message-in-a-bottle man. She finds him at a sleepy North Carolina port, working on his beloved sailboat, <i>The Happenstance</i>. From there, a romance buds and blossoms into a colorful bouquet of emotional baggage. Theresa has problems with her past--or, more accurately, her past is a problem. She is so scarred from her "I'm a super churchgoing guy now that I've run out on my wife" ex-husband that she hasn't tried to date since her divorce some three or four years before. And who is Catherine? And what's Garret's bag, anyway? When Theresa finds out, she plunges to the depths of her soul and uncorks a whopper of a secret about herself, bringing Garret to terms with who he really is. </p><p> <i>Message in a Bottle</i> has the earmarks of sentimental tongue-wagging at its finest and should please romantics and cynics alike--it's sure to bring romantics to their knees, while cynics will be slapping theirs in laughter. <i>--Rebekah Warren</i></p>With over 6 million copies in print of his first two New York Times bestsellers, THE NOTEBOOK and MESSAGE IN A BOTTLE, Nicholas Sparks has become one of the world's most beloved storytellers...and one whose poignant tales renew our faith in the lasting power of true love.<p>Theresa Osborne is divorced and disillusioned, but all that is about to change when she finds a bottle on the beach with a mysterious love letter inside.

Gillian Cross and Neil Packer&#x2019;s exquisite versions of <i>The Iliad </i>and <i>The Odyssey</i> make up an essential set for both Homer collectors and readers who have not yet made the acquaintance of Odysseus, Achilles, or Hector. Depicting their actions, and those of the gods they invoke, are vivid, stylistic illustrations reminiscent of Greek pottery, giving these large-format volumes an extra measure of authenticity and appeal. From the raging battles outside the walls of Troy to the strangely surreal ten years it takes Odysseus to journey home, these bold re-envisionings of Homer&#x2019;s stories are told with simplicity and style &#x2014; perfect for fans of graphic retellings and mythology enthusiasts alike.</p><p><b>Gillian Cross </b>is the Carnegie Medal&#x2013;winning author of <i>Wolf.</i> She lives in England.<br><br><b>Neil Packer<i> </i></b>has illustrated several classic books, including <i>One Hundred Years of Solitude.</i> He lives in London.Gr 6&#x2013;9&#x2014;Cross presents a fluid and highly readable version of this celebrated tale. The text follows the essential plot structure of the classic work, beginning with Helen's capture and concluding with Hector's demise. The book includes an introduction to the Odyssey (retold by this creative team in 2012) and provides brief historical context of the Bronze Age eastern Mediterranean. A helpful spread groups the characters by their allegiance (Greek or Trojan). Cross conveys the various personalities of the story's many heroes and gods, including jealous Achilles and courageous Hector. The gods weave in and out of the text. Packer's dreamlike illustrations illuminate the stories with bold, solid colors, the stylized figures influenced by poses and perspectives from ancient pottery. Some white-on-black illustrations are particularly striking, exhibiting strong emotion and movement. Images range in size from one-quarter of a page to full spreads. In addition, the illustrations often include the names of characters and places in Greek script, a nice feature also found in ancient art. The text dramatizes the intense battle sequences, but there isn't much blood or gore. Central elements of the story, including death and hardship, are presented in a forthright manner. The content and the imagery are appropriate for readers who need something more serious than sanitized versions but who might be a few years away from more mature-themed retellings, such as Gareth Hinds's The Odyssey (Candlewick, 2010). VERDICT A beautiful, fluid, and action-packed retelling of a timeless classic.&#x2014;Jeffrey Meyer, Mt.

Compared to the absolute catastrophe of generalizing the secret taxing authority presumption, all the hell of Obamacare is merely one example, with an infinite number of the same kinds of tax laws right behind it, waiting only for Congress to vote.

(25-pack)</h2><p><p><strong>Who Is Jesus?</strong></p><ul><li>A Historical Person</li><li>An Extraordinary Person</li><li>God</li><li>One of Us</li><li>Alive</li></ul><p><strong>A Historical Person</strong></p><p>Maybe you have never really thought about who Jesus is, or whether his claims have any implications for your life. After all, we&#x2019;re talking about a man who was born in the first century into an obscure Jewish carpenter&#x2019;s family. The basic facts of his life&#x2015;where and when he lived, how he died&#x2015;are all pretty well agreed upon. But what about the significance of his life and death? Was he a prophet? A teacher? Was he the Son of God, or just an unusually gifted man? And for that matter, who did he think he was? For all the questions, though, everyone seems to agree on one thing: Jesus was an extraordinary person.</p><p><strong>An Extraordinary Person</strong></p><p>Without a doubt, in his day there was something about Jesus that caught people&#x2019;s attention. Over and over Jesus said things that left his contemporaries amazed at his wisdom, and even confronted them in ways that left them fumbling around for a way to make sense of it all. (Matthew 22:22).</p><p>&#x201c;Many who heard him were astonished, saying, &#x2018;What is the wisdom given to him?&#x2019; . . . and &#x2018;How are such mighty works done by his hands?&#x2019;&#x201d; (Mark 6:2)&nbsp;</p><p>Then there were the miracles. Hundreds and hundreds of people saw with their own eyes Jesus do things that no human being should be able to do. He healed people from sickness; he made water instantly turn into fine-tasting wine; he told lame people to walk again, and they did; he stood on the prow of a boat and told the ocean to be quiet&#x2015;and it did; he stood in front of the tomb of a man who had been dead for four days and called to him to come back to life&#x2015;and the man&nbsp;heard him, stood up, and walked out of the tomb (Matthew 8:24&#x2013;27; 9:6&#x2013;7; John 2:1&#x2013;11; 11:38&#x2013;44).&nbsp;</p><p>With every one of his miracles and in every one of his sermons Jesus was making and backing up claims about himself that no human being had ever made before&#x2015;claims that he was God.</p><p><strong>God</strong></p><p>On a number of occasions Jesus took a name for himself exclusively used for God, the present tense &#x201c;I am&#x201d; (John 8:48&#x2013;58), which brought to mind the ancient and famous name of Israel&#x2019;s almighty God (Exodus 3:14).&nbsp;</p><p>Prophecies that Jesus claimed to fulfill also pointed to his deity. The people of Israel were looking forward to a king occupying the centuries-vacant throne. One prophet described this King as &#x201c;Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace. Of the increase of his government and of peace there will be no end&#x201d; (Isaiah 9:6&#x2013;7). The people of that day would have seen that this promised King didn&#x2019;t sound like just another man who would sit on the throne for a time and then die. They would have heard their God promising that he himself would come and be their King.</p><p>Jesus also asserted his identity as, &#x201c;the Son of God.&#x201d; It wasn&#x2019;t just a royal title; it was also a claim that Jesus was equal to God in status and character and honor. John explains: &#x201c;This was why the Jews were seeking all the more to kill him, because . . . he was even calling God his own Father, making himself equal with God&#x201d; (John 5:18).</p><p><strong>One of Us</strong></p><p>Christians call the reality that God became human the incarnation. The Bible tells us that Jesus got hungry, he got thirsty, he got tired, and he even got sleepy. He did things with a deeply human tenderness, compassion, and love (Matthew 15:32; Mark 6:34, John 11:33&#x2013;36). He not only was human; he showed us what God intended humanity to be all along.&nbsp;</p><p>Jesus was identifying with us, becoming one with us so that he could represent us in life and death. When Adam, the first man, sinned, he did so as the representative of all who would come after him (Genesis 3:1&#x2013;15). &#x201c;One trespass led to condemnation for all men&#x201d; (Romans 5:18). Jesus would let God&#x2019;s sentence of death&#x2015;his righteous wrath against sinners&#x2015;fall on him. So, Jesus allowed one of his own disciples to betray him to the Roman authorities who sentenced him to be crucified. In Jesus&#x2019;s death on the cross, all the sin of God&#x2019;s people was placed on him. Jesus died for them. He died in their place. There&#x2019;s only one thing that would lead the Son of God to do this: he deeply loves us. &#x201c;For God so loved the world,&#x201d; one biblical writer said, &#x201c;that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life&#x201d; (John 3:16).&nbsp;</p><p>But Jesus did not remain dead. When some disciples entered Jesus&#x2019;s tomb two days later, &#x201c;they saw a young man sitting on the right side, dressed in a white robe, and they were alarmed. And he said to them, &#x2018;Do not be alarmed. You seek Jesus of Nazareth, who was crucified. He has risen; he is not here&#x2019;&#x201d; (Mark 16:5&#x2013;6).&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Alive</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>Through Jesus&#x2019;s resurrection from the dead, something breathtakingly extraordinary happened. Everything he ever claimed for himself was vindicated. (1 Corinthians 15:14&#x2013;19).&nbsp;</p><p>Only the resurrection had the power to turn his own followers&#x2015;cowardly, skeptical men&#x2015;into martyrs and eyewitnesses who were willing to stake everything on him for the sake of telling the world, &#x201c;This man Jesus was crucified, but now he is alive!&#x201d;&nbsp;</p><p>The resurrection is the hinge on which all Christianity turns. It&#x2019;s the foundation on which everything else rests, the capstone that holds everything else about Christianity together.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Who Do You Say He Is?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Maybe you&#x2019;re not ready to believe his claims. What is holding you back? Once you identify those things, don&#x2019;t just walk away from them. Examine them. Pursue them. Find answers to&nbsp;your questions. Don&#x2019;t put this off. This is the most important question you&#x2019;ll ever consider!&nbsp;</p><p>Maybe you&#x2019;re ready to say, &#x201c;I really do think Jesus is the Son of God. I know I&#x2019;m a sinner and a rebel against God. I know I deserve death for that rebellion, and I know Jesus can save me.&#x201d; If so, then you simply turn away from sin and trust Jesus, and rely on him to save you. And then you tell the world! This is who Jesus is. He is the One who saves people just like me, and just like you!&nbsp;</p></p><p><p><strong>Greg Gilbert</strong> (MDiv, The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary) is senior pastor at Third Avenue Baptist Church in Louisville, Kentucky.

School was school&#x2014;he tried hard, but there were times he just felt lost, in search of answers that wouldn&#x2019;t come.<br>&nbsp;<br>And no matter how hard he tried, how hard he could try, he<br>was never going to make sense out of what was happening to his friend Abby.<br>&nbsp;<br>But on a Saturday morning like this, underneath all the sun and blue sky, with the guys in the line already into their blocks and Nate feeling as if he had all day to throw the ball&#x2014;feeling that weird calm he always felt in the pocket&#x2014;he had all the answers.<br>&nbsp;<br>Football was like this for Nate Brodie.<br>&nbsp;<br>As he scanned the field now, he recognized one of those answers he instinctively knew. Pete Mullaney, his favorite receiver, was about to break into the clear. Once he did that, Nate knew Pete was going to run all day.<br>&nbsp;<br>When it was just Nate and Pete and some of the other guys on the team playing touch football in the empty lot next to Nate&#x2019;s house, they called this play &#x201c;Hutchins-and-Go.&#x201d; One day Nate had told Pete to fake toward the Hutchins&#x2019; house, the one on the other side of the lot, fake like he was running a sideline pattern in that direction, and then, as soon as the guy covering him bit, Pete was supposed to plant his outside foot and spin and take off down the sidelines.<br>&nbsp;<br>The play had just always been called Hutchins-and-Go after that.<br>&nbsp;<br>Nate watched as Pete sold his fake now, sold it like he was selling candy, didn&#x2019;t rush, even turned and looked back for the ball. That was when the defensive back on him committed, turned, and looked for the ball himself.<br>&nbsp;<br>Only Pete was gone.<br>&nbsp;<br>And the ball wasn&#x2019;t coming, at least not yet.<br>&nbsp;<br>Now it was just a question of what kind of throw Nate wanted to make. Because with the kind of arm he had&#x2014;his buds and teammates always called him &#x201c;Brady,&#x201d; knowing that Tom Brady was Nate&#x2019;s all-time favorite player&#x2014;there were a couple of ways he could go. Nate could put a lot of air beneath the ball, really hang it up there and let Pete use those jets of his to run under it. Or Nate could gun one right now, throw one of those dead spirals that was the same as one of his football fastballs, put so much sting and hurt at the end of the pass that Pete sometimes said he wished he was allowed to wear a catcher&#x2019;s mitt.<br>&nbsp;<br>Nate decided to put this one way up there.<br>&nbsp;<br>Moon shot.<br>&nbsp;<br>He rolled to his right now, feeling pressure coming from his left, a right-handed quarterback&#x2019;s blind side, without actually seeing it. But just to make sure, to know exactly how much time he had, he shot a quick look over his shoulder and saw that the<br>Hollins Hills&#x2019; nose tackle had cleared Malcolm Burnley, Nate&#x2019;s center and the best blocker Valley had, on an outside route and was coming hard, thinking he might have a shot at getting his first sack of the day.<br>&nbsp;<br>Nate knew he didn&#x2019;t.<br>&nbsp;<br>In no hurry, Nate kept moving toward the sideline, toward the Valley bench, almost feeling as if he were floating. Having cleared the pocket completely, a nice patch of open green waited for him a few yards in front of Coach Rivers.<br>&nbsp;<br>He stopped now, planting, making sure to square his shoulders so he didn&#x2019;t drop his arm angle and sidearm the ball, setting himself on his back foot, carrying the ball high. The throwing mechanics that Coach said you pretty much had to be born with.<br>&nbsp;<br>And he let the ball rip.<br>&nbsp;<br>Knowing that the cornerback who had been covering Pete was never going to catch up with him and that the Hollins Hills safety had no chance of getting over to the sideline in time.<br>&nbsp;<br>He watched the ball like it was on a string, like one of those perfect casts his dad used to make across the water when the two of them still had time to go fishing together, before his dad began working all the time.<br>&nbsp;<br>He hoped his mom was getting this on the video recorder that was on its last legs and had been for a while, because his dad&#x2014;working a double shift on Saturdays now&#x2014;wasn&#x2019;t here to see it in person.<br>&nbsp;<br>The ball came down into Pete Mullaney&#x2019;s hands, Pete in perfect stride, just crossing the Hollins Hills 10-yard line.<br>&nbsp;<br>Pete pressed the ball to the front of his white uniform with those sure hands of his and crossed the goal line. Then he turned and just tossed the ball to the referee, because if you played on a team with Nate Brodie, if he was the one throwing you the ball, you knew enough not to do some kind of crazy touchdown dance afterward.<br>&nbsp;<br>You could be happy, just not happy enough to show the other team up.<br>&nbsp;<br>Nate was running down the sideline now, almost as fast as Pete just had. All the things that were confusing about his thirteen-year-old life lately&#x2014;the things that made him sad and just plain mad once he got away from a football field&#x2014;Nate had left them all in his dust.<br>By the time Nate got to Pete, the little wide receiver was on the Valley sideline, waiting for him with his arms stretched wide. Nate, taller than Pete by a whole helmet, grabbed him, picked him up, put him down just as quickly, as much celebration as he was going to allow himself, mostly because there was still some game left to play.<br>&nbsp;<br>Pete said, &#x201c;That throw was legit.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;You always say that,&#x201d; Nate said.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;No, Brady, this time I really mean it. That throw was, like, righteous.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Nate laughed now, couldn&#x2019;t help it. &#x201c;I had the wind behind me.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Pete Mullaney shook his head, smiling from behind his face mask. &#x201c;Dude,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;as far as I can tell, your arm is pretty much where the wind starts.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Nate ran over to Coach Rivers then, to get the play Coach wanted them to run on the conversion. Then he ran back on the field and told his teammates he was faking to LaDell and then taking it in himself, on a roll to his left.<br>&nbsp;<br>Nobody touched him. Valley was up 22&#x2013;7. They all knew the game was over, even with the clock showing two minutes, straight up, left.<br>&nbsp;<br>He and Pete ran off the field together, knowing that the forty-yarder they&#x2019;d just hooked up on had put this one in the books.<br>&nbsp;<br>When Nate got back to the bench, Coach Rivers gave him a simple handshake.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;A Brady throw all the way,&#x201d; he said.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I wish,&#x201d; Nate said.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m serious,&#x201d; Coach said. &#x201c;Biggest throw of the season.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>For now, Nate thought.<br>&nbsp;<br>For now.</p><h2>Seedfolks</h2><p>Fictional Novel, Literary Fiction, Children's Fiction &amp; Literature</p><p>Sometimes, even in the middle of ugliness and neglect, a little bit of beauty will bloom.

Directed by Oscar winner Sydney Pollack, Out of Africa is the fascinating true story of Karen Blixen, a strong-willed woman who, with her philandering husband (Klaus Maria Brandauer), runs a coffee plantation in Kenya, circa 1914. To her astonishment, she soon discovers herself falling in love with the land, its people and a mysterious white hunter (Redford). The masterfully crafted, breathtakingly produced story of love and loss earned Oscars for Best Picture, Director, Screenplay (based on material from another medium), Cinematography, Original Score, Art Direction (Set Decoration) and Sound.</p><p>Sydney Pollack's approach to audio commentary for DVD editions of his films is different from that of most other directors. Instead of detailing each scene of <i>Out of Africa</i>, for example, Pollack paints in broad strokes, talking about cinematic themes and in particular the translation of Karen Blixen's life in Africa from book to film. The fan of flubs and trivia won't find Pollack making any cute remarks, but he's certainly interesting for the run of the film, describing the location shooting in Africa and how he dealt with Robert Redford's casting and lack of accent. The new 45-minute documentary <i>A Song of Africa</i> has old and new interviews with Pollack and Meryl Streep, who clearly should have shared the film's commentary duties; she's insightful and quite fun to listen to. The documentary also includes new interviews with composer John Barry and Blixen historian Judith Thompson. <i>--Doug Thomas</i></p><h2>Map Skills for Today: Grade 2: Take a Trip with Us</h2><p>Junior tour guides Jordan and Jamie take second graders along on a trip that includes mapping neighborhoods and states, using a compass and designing maps with keys and symbols, working with grids and scales, and understanding national boundaries (political maps) and landforms.

If you won&#x2019;t take my word for it and have no vested interest in broadening your worldview, here&#x2019;s the most important takeaway: Iran is not pronounced I-ran; it&#x2019;s pronounced e-ron. Spread the word. Tell all your friends. Tweet it. Shout it from the rooftops. Correct people. It&#x2019;ll make you sound smart and cultured. On behalf of my fellow Iranians (e-ron-ians), we thank you.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Now, for those juicy historical details you were promised! Real talk: Iran has dealt with its fair share of strife and political unrest. And while I&#x2019;m not one to point fingers or lay blame . . . the United States and Britain were totally at fault. Okay, that&#x2019;s not entirely accurate. The West might not be directly accountable for all of Iran&#x2019;s drama, but they definitely stirred the pot, back in the early 1950s. During that time, Prime Minister Mohammad Mossadegh ruled Iran. Personally, I consider the man a hero. He was a democratically elected leader, and a progressive. But his main claim to fame was that he nationalized Iran&#x2019;s oil industry. Prior to Mossadegh, the country&#x2019;s most valuable resource was under British control. But why let the Brits instead of Iranians profit off of Iran&#x2019;s most lucrative industry? That&#x2019;s the equivalent of Kanye West pocketing all the profits from 1989 (the Taylor Swift album, not the year in history). Thus, Iran told the British oil companies to hit the road, and the Brits were predictably pissed. Mossadegh to Britain: &#x201c;Bye, Felicia.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So Britain decided to call in a favor to their bestie: the United States. If texting had existed at that time, then Winston Churchill would have sent President Eisenhower a bunch of crying-faced emojis. According to Churchill, they needed to get rid of Mossadegh. The United States was initially reluctant to get involved, but Britain pointed out that Iran&#x2019;s beloved prime minister had newly gained the support of the Tudeh Party (an Iranian communist party) and the country would eventually go red. (Oh, hell no it wouldn&#x2019;t. Our man Mossadegh wasn&#x2019;t even a fan of socialism. Not to mention, the Tudeh Party frequently turned against him.) So Eisenhower said, &#x201c;We&#x2019;re in!&#x201d; And that&#x2019;s when the CIA and Britain&#x2019;s Secret Intelligence Service decided to buddy up and formulate a secret coup to overthrow Mossadegh. They called it: Operation Ajax. Possibly named for the mythological Greek hero or the cleaning product. Your guess is as good as mine. It was decided that Iran&#x2019;s ruling monarch at the time, Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi (yes, &#x201c;Mohammad&#x201d; is like the &#x201c;Mike&#x201d; of Iran), would take over for Mossadegh. Initially, the shah said, &#x201c;You people are nuts! Everyone loves Mossadegh. You&#x2019;re asking me to commit political suicide.&#x201d; But then the United States threatened to dismiss the shah as well, and he was like: &#x201c;How soon do we get this overthrow party started?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Long story short, the coup was a success. Mossadegh was jailed for three years and then placed under house arrest, till his death in 1967. Kind of ironic that today the United States would really love more democratic countries in the Middle East, and Iran was one, until the CIA got involved. J&#x2019;accuse! The short-term wins for the United States and United Kingdom included regaining limited access to Iran&#x2019;s oil by having a stake in a holding company called Iranian Oil Participants, or IOP. After the overthrow of Mossadegh, public opinion in Iran was so against the Brits taking total control of the country&#x2019;s oil supply again that IOP was the United Kingdom&#x2019;s next best option.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Meanwhile, post-coup, the shah and his family were living it up on diamond-studded thrones until everything went off the rails again, in 1978. This time, the political unrest wasn&#x2019;t orchestrated by foreign powers. It was the people of Iran who were fed up with the monarchy, and they had good reason. For starters, the Pahlavi family was ridiculously rich, and shamelessly extravagant with their money. Iranians respected properly gained wealth, but they objected to the shah&#x2019;s fortune, because much of it was stolen from the people. Which is why, beyond the walls of the palace, the country&#x2019;s economy was in the crapper. Families struggled to put food on the table, while the royal family spent hundreds of millions of dollars on parties to celebrate the monarchy. Not to mention that the shah had a secret police force called SAVAK, which had a reputation for torturing and executing anyone who opposed the monarchy. (Side note: America and Israel helped establish SAVAK. In fact, the CIA helped train the officers, which means they played a significant role in the torture and murder of thousands of shah detractors.) But at this point, even the United States was over the shah because . . . wait for it . . . he increased the price of oil. The overwhelming dislike for the Pahlavi dynasty gave birth to the Iranian Revolution, and by then my parents were also fed up with the regime&#x2019;s inhumane tactics. My baba, Ali, joined the protests, and eventually the shah was exiled.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Mostly everyone in Iran: &#x201c;SWEET!&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But with every revolution comes the risk that the new regime might suck worse than the old one, and some felt that happened when the Ayatollah Khomeini (the guy with the long beard and turban--&#x201c;imam&#x201d; accessories that many now associate with stereotypes like: terrorism) came into power. Keep in mind that the Tehran of my parents&#x2019; generation (during the shah&#x2019;s reign) was a burgeoning metropolis with European sensibilities. My maman (1) walked the streets of her neighborhood in itty-bitty miniskirts, with her long, wavy brown hair blowing freely in the wind.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>During his bachelor days, my dad regularly had girlfriends who he could take out in public. The consumption of alcohol was legal, and no one had to worry about the religious police arresting them for throwing a coed party. Tehran (the country&#x2019;s capital) was a vacation hot spot, and a travel destination for many Westerners. Also, just so we&#x2019;re clear--my parents didn&#x2019;t travel around town on a camel. If you want to picture Tehran in your head, don&#x2019;t conjure up images of Agrabah (the fictional city in Aladdin). Think New York City.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But when Khomeini came to power, he founded the Islamic Republic of Iran and introduced Islamic law(2) to the country. Suddenly there were strict dress codes for women that required them to cover up their hair, men and women (unless they were married) were mostly segregated, Western music and movies were banned, and alcohol became illegal. For some, Khomeini was a total buzzkill. Of course, the new laws thrilled the country&#x2019;s religious citizens, but my mostly secular family wasn&#x2019;t having it. My mom had great hair. It would have been a cardinal sin to cover up those luscious chestnut locks. That said, while the country was deprived of my mom&#x2019;s shampoo-commercial-quality tresses, there were also benefits to the Islamic Revolution. For instance, the literacy rate in Iran nearly tripled (up to 97 percent, higher than the United States&#x2019;), because social conservatives were comfortable with sending their daughters to school, now that their classmates would also be wearing head scarves. One could argue that the revolution oppressed women, while others could argue it helped liberate them.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Meanwhile, the shah and his family, now in exile, were desperately looking for a country to take them in. President Carter reluctantly allowed them into the United States so the shah could receive surgery for non-Hodgkin&#x2019;s lymphoma, but then all hell broke loose in Tehran. Iranians wanted the shah returned to the country so he could be tried for war crimes. When the United States refused to send him back, a bunch of Iranian students stormed the US embassy and took fifty-two Americans hostage (see: the Academy Award&#x2013;winning movie Argo). As if a hostage crisis and an Iranian revolution weren&#x2019;t complicated enough, by 1980 the country also found itself at war with Iraq. The conflict was mostly geopolitical, with a long-standing border dispute between both nations. With the support of the United States (ahem), Iraq invaded Iran. At this point, the United States was politically motivated to back Iraq in the war. After Iran&#x2019;s revolution, the new regime was pushing hostile propaganda against the West. Iran was also gaining allies in the Middle East, and the US government worried the country would become the sole power in the region, thus wielding far too much influence. But guess what else happened in 1980?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I was born!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>(1) Maman means &#x201c;mom&#x201d; in Farsi.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>(2) Islamic law (also referred to as Sharia) is a set of moral laws that come from the Qur&#x2019;an instead of legislation by the people. Some aspects of Islamic law are observed in Iran&#x2019;s legal system, but today the country mostly operates under civil law, ratified by the parliament.</p></p><h2>Bad Hair Day (8) (Franny K.

On Saturdays, she visits Grandma and Grandpa, who come from a European-American background, and on Sundays -- <i>los domingos --</i> she visits <i>Abuelito y Abuelita,</i> who are Mexican-American. While the two sets of grandparents are different in many ways, they also have a great deal in common -- in particular, their love for their granddaughter. <br> While we follow our narrator to the circus and the pier, share stories from her grandparents' pasts, and celebrate her birthday, the depth and joy of both cultures are conveyed in Spanish and English. This affirmation of both heritages will speak to all children who want to know more about their own families and ethnic backgrounds.</p><p>Alma Flor Ada, an authority on multicultural and bilingual education, is the recipient of the 2012 Virginia Hamilton Literary Award, and in 2014 she was honored by the Mexican government with the prestigious OHTLI Award. She is the author of numerous award-winning books for young readers, including <i>Dancing Home </i>with Gabriel Zubizarreta, <i>My Name Is Mar�a Isabel</i>, <i>Under the Royal Palms </i>(Pura Belpr� Medal), <i>Where the Flame Trees Bloom</i>, and <i>The Gold Coin </i>(Christopher Award Medal). She lives in California, and you can visit her at AlmaFlorAda.com.Through this affectionate and revealing portrait of a bilingual girl's weekend visits to her two sets of grandparents, Ada (Where the Flame Trees Bloom) and Savadier (A Bedtime Story) prove that straddling two worlds can be a blessing rather than a hardship. The left of each spread depicts the narrator spending Saturdays with her paternal grandparents, with whom she speaks English; on the right, she passes los domingos (Sundays) with her Mexican-American Abuelito and Abuelita and converses in Spanish. The situations in the two households share enough similarities that readers can extrapolate the meaning of the Spanish words in context. For instance, on one spread, the colors of the balloons her paternal grandparents give her also appear in the kite that her Abuelito makes for her. Each pairing makes for a loving comparison and contrast, enlivened by Savadier's graceful, warm-toned watercolor spot illustrations. At book's end, both sets of grandparents coordinate a cooperative gift for the girl's birthday. The balance tips slightly in Abuelito and Abuelita's favor, in terms of fun and exoticism (e.g., Grandpa and Grandma watch a video about the circus while the Mexican-American grandparents "take me to a real circus"). Youngsters, however, will come away with the idea that this girl is very lucky to have four such interesting people who love her. Ages 4-8. <p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Essential Elements for Band - Tuba in C (B.C.)

It&#x2019;s been used as a bowl for popcorn, ice cream, cereal, and dog food. And two babies have been christened in it.<br> &nbsp;<br> It&#x2019;s the stuff of tradition and legend. And it all started with one man: a British lord, Frederick Arthur Stanley.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>Chapter 1:&nbsp;The Start of It All</b><br> &nbsp;<br><br> Ice hockey has roots in ball-and-stick games, dating back to the earliest civilizations. In colder climates, people played these sports on frozen ponds, eventually on skates. Canada, though, is considered the true birthplace of hockey, combining these games and First Nations (Canadian indigenous people) traditions. In Montreal, James Creighton, the &#x201c;Father of Organized Hockey,&#x201d; introduced the first real rules, holding an &#x201c;official&#x201d; hockey game indoors&#x2014;using a puck instead of a ball&#x2014;in 1875.<br> &nbsp;<br> During the sport&#x2019;s early years, players didn&#x2019;t wear helmets, padding, or goalie masks. They stayed on the ice every second of the game. There were no nets, just posts hammered into the ice.<br> &nbsp;<br> In June 1888, Lord Frederick Arthur Stanley and his family arrived in Canada. Queen Victoria of England had named him governor-general. At the time, Canada was a &#x201c;dominion&#x201d;&#x2014;or territory&#x2014;of England. The governor-general was appointed by the British king or queen to govern Canada.<br> &nbsp;<br> None of the Stanleys knew about hockey. But Lord Stanley and his eight children loved sports. After seeing a game in Montreal, they were hooked. Two of the Stanley brothers formed a team of seven players, the standard number back then. They traveled in their father&#x2019;s private train to play other teams. Throughout the country, people took notice. This was the important governor-general&#x2019;s family!<br> &nbsp;<br> The game became popular in northern US cities, too. Meanwhile, more leagues formed.<br> &nbsp;<br> In time, Lord Stanley&#x2019;s children wanted to hold a championship; one winner named from among all the different leagues. Lord Stanley donated a silver punch bowl to use for the trophy. So the Stanley Cup isn&#x2019;t really a &#x201c;cup&#x201d; at all.<br> &nbsp;<br> According to Lord Stanley&#x2019;s wishes, the trophy was a &#x201c;challenge cup.&#x201d; What did that mean?<br> &nbsp;<br> Teams had two ways to win the trophy. One way was simple enough. A team just had to be in the same league as the last champions and finish first in standings, beating out the reigning Cup-holder.<br> &nbsp;<br> Then there was the &#x201c;challenge&#x201d; way. To get the Cup, teams from different leagues had to challenge the championship team to a game or series of games. And of course, the challenger had to win. Challenges could come any time&#x2014;before, during, or after the hockey season. And there were no limits on how many could be issued.

"I've grown too big for this little shell." Much-loved master of cut-paper collage Eric Carle created <i>A House for Hermit Crab</i> to comfort any little ones (okay, and adults, too) who dread change--whether the new shell is a new home, a new school, or a new experience. In this soothing, upbeat story, Hermit Crab casts his eyestalks on a newer, bigger shell, but it seems plain and unwelcoming at first. When he meets some beautiful, swaying sea anemones, he asks if one of them will come to adorn the outside of his shell. In time a colorful sea star, some coral, an industrious sea snail, a fortress-protecting sea urchin, and an illuminating lantern fish all join forces with him, making his house a home. Much to his dismay, just when his dwelling and new family fit him to a T, he finds he's physically outgrown his shell yet again. Instead of bemoaning his fate, he eagerly spots a newer, bigger shell--to him a fresh, blank artist's canvas--and relishes the thought of all the undersea home-improvement possibilities: sponges, barnacles, clown fish, and more! Kids will love Carle's rich, affectionate portrayal of Hermit Crab's ocean odyssey, and the gentle story may help them see that giving up the old for the new is not a loss, but an opportunity.

Adherence to the faith was a great personal risk, with the Roman Empire leading the first of such persecutions against early Christian believers. Many were crucified, put to the sword, or burned alive - gruesome forms of death designed to terrify and discourage others from following the same beliefs. <br><br> Appearing in 1563, Foxe's chronicle of Christian suffering proved a great success among Protestants. It gave literate Christians the ability to discover and read about brave believers who died for expressing their religion, much as did Jesus Christ. Perhaps in foretelling, the final chapter of the book focuses upon the earliest Christian missions abroad: these, to the Americas, Asia and other locales, would indeed see many more martyrs put to death by the local populations. <br><br> Foxe's Book of Martyrs caused controversy for condemning the Catholic Church for its persecution of Protestant sects it had branded heretical. To a great extent, Foxe's thesis embodies the rebellious outrage that fueled the upheaval of the established order in the 16th century. It galvanized Protestant beliefs and served as a grim reminder of the injustices those divergent from Catholicism had faced in earlier centuries. <br><br> Critics would, over the years, attempt to discredit Foxe's work by pointing out perceived inaccuracies or falsehoods - despite their efforts, the Book of Martyrs' influence did not wane. Modern academics however, in reviewing Foxe's sources and performing a close analysis of the Book of Martyrs, concluded that he was a credible scholar whose output was a worthy and valuable contribution to Christian literature. The English historian Patrick Collinson concludes: <br><br> <i>"Foxe helped to shape the controversy along historical and prophetic lines, rather than epistemological or linguistic ones."</i> <br><br> This edition is a reproduction of Foxe's first, published in 1563. As such it is shorter than later editions, which would see other authors greatly add to the list of martyrs contained. Together with the principle text, the book also contains praise from three distinguished English writers, together with a short, introductory biography of Foxe himself.</p><p>Foxe&#39;s Book of Martyrs was first published over five hundred years ago. Today, there are many editions of this book available. When Lighthouse Trails decided to start offering this book to our readers, we began our search for a suitable edition. Much to our dismay, we discovered that many of the current editions were compromised in one form or another. For example, in one edition (ironically, published by an advocacy group for persecuted Christians), front page endorsements included the names of those who promote contemplative spirituality and/or the emerging church. When one realizes that contemplative/emerging spirituality embraces some of the very same beliefs that Foxe s martyrs opposed to the point of suffering cruel persecution and death, it is most troubling and misleading to see these names in the cover of an edition of Foxe s Book of Martyrs. In another edition we reviewed, the book was among a special set of Christian classics. We were once again perplexed to see that some of the other books in that series were written by contemplative mystics. And yet another edition, published by a secular publisher, advertised mystical and occult practices on the back cover. Finally, after an unsuccessful search, Lighthouse Trails decided to publish our own edition of this truly incredible and unforgettable account. And whatsoever ye do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God and the Father by him.

" - Seira Wilson, Amazon Editor<br><br>On a simple trip to the park, the joy of music overtakes a mother and daughter. The little girl hears a rhythm coming from the world around her- from butterflies, to street performers, to ice cream sellers everything is musical! She sniffs, snaps, and shakes her way into the heart of the beat, finally busting out in an impromptu dance, which all the kids join in on! Award-winning illustrator Frank Morrison and Connie Schofield-Morrison, capture the beat of the street, to create a rollicking read that will get any kid in the mood to boogie.</p><p><b>Connie Schofield-Morrison </b>and<b> Frank Morrison</b> have teamed up for the first time to capture the rhythm of the neighborhood. Connie has been writing since she was a young girl and is inspired every day by the big sounds and bright colors of the world around her. <i>I Got the Rhythm</i> is her first picture book. Frank works as a fine artist and is a National Book Award finalist and an NAACP Image Award-winning illustrator of many books for children including <i>Our Children Can Soar </i>and <i>Jazzy Miz Mozetta,</i> for which he won the Coretta Scott King/John Steptoe New Talent Award. Connie and Frank live in Atlanta, Georgia, with their five children.PreS-Gr 1&#x2014;A young girl discovers a world of exuberant rhythm in her neighborhood, from the drummer in the park to playground clapping games to the subtle beat of butterfly wings. The straightforward narrative captures the engaging ways the narrator finds her own rhythm exploring the world around her. She "[hears] a rhythm with [her] ears," "[looks] at the rhythm with [her] eyes," "[catches] the rhythm with [her] hands," and much more. Ready made for storytime, Schofield-Morrison's text pulses with a beat of its own and practically demands audiences to clap along. Each double-page spread offers interactive elements that work for a range of ages, from vocabulary presenting each way the narrator catches the rhythm (hands, knees, feet, and more) to the fun readers can have joining in and keeping the rhythm with their own fingers, singing it with their own mouth, or tapping it with their own toes. Morrison's oil-on-canvas illustrations take their lead from the energetic text but form the core of the story with expansive spreads crackling with movement. A rich, color palette helps the action jump off the page, with a bright blue sky as the backdrop for the yellows and golds and greens of the setting complementing an array of pinks, especially the narrator's bright pink dress. The urban setting and varied cast of characters make this title particularly valuable, showcasing diversity as an integral part of everyday life.&#x2014;Ted McCoy, Springfield City Library, MA</p><h2>Laurence King Bug Bingo</h2><p>This beautifully illustrated bingo game features 64 species of bugs from around the world.

She took him to court--and won! Before she was Sojourner Truth, she was known simply as Belle. Born a slave in New York sometime around 1797, she was later sold and separated from her family. Even after she escaped from slavery, she knew her work was not yet done. She changed her name and traveled, inspiring everyone she met and sharing her story until her death in 1883 at age eighty-six. In this easy-to-read biography, Yona Zeldis McDonough continues to share that remarkable story.</p><p>Yona McDonough is the author of What Was the Underground Railroad?, Who Was Rosa Parks?, Who Was John F. Kennedy?, Who Was Louis Armstrong?, Who Was Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart? and Who Was Harriet Tubman? She lives in New York City.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>Who Was Sojourner Truth?<br> &nbsp;<br> June 1, 1843<br> &nbsp;<br> The tall woman walked down to the ferry in New York City, paid the fare, and got on. <br> &nbsp;<br> Although the woman was black and had been born a slave, she was now free to come and go as she pleased. When the ride ended, she got off the ferry and began to walk. Soon, the hustle and bustle of the city was far behind her. After a while, she grew thirsty and stopped at a farm to ask for a drink. The woman who gave it to her asked her name. The tall woman thought about this. The only full name she had was a slave name, given to her by her master. She did not want that name anymore. She was starting a new life. She was going to be doing a lot of traveling. And she was going to spread the word of God. <br> &nbsp;<br> So, right then and there she gave herself a new name. She decided to call herself Sojourner Truth, and this is her story.</p></p><h2>Fodor&#39;s Barcelona: with highlights of Catalonia (Full-color Travel Guide)</h2><p><b>Ready to experience Barcelona?

When Theodore Roosevelt taught Sunday school for a time, a boy showed up one Sunday with a black eye. He admitted he had been fighting and on a Sunday too. He told the future president that a bigger boy had been pinching his sister, and so he fought him. TR told him that he had done perfectly right and gave him a dollar. The stodgy vestrymen thought this was a bit much, and so they let their exuberant Sunday school teacher go. What a loss. Unbelief cannot look past surfaces. Unbelief squashes; faith teaches. Faith takes a boy aside and tells him that this part of what he did was good, while that other part of he did got in the way. &#34;And this is how to do it better next time.&#34; As we look to Scripture for patterns of masculinity for our sons, we find them manifested perfectly in the life of the Lord Jesus Christ. He is the one who set the ultimate pattern for friendship and courage, for faithfulness and integrity.</p><p><b>Douglas Wilson</b> is a Senior Fellow of theology at New Saint Andrews College.

Though we've all needed to get creative from time to time and been forced to mix up tipples with a butter knife in a pinch, being equipped with the right barware can go a long way toward creating consistent cocktails and improving the quality of your game. Here's an introductory set of suggestions to get you started.<br><br> Jigger (measuring cup for drinks): Most jiggers have two sides to measure different increments. While they come in many sizes, a good place to start is with one jigger that has a 1-ounce small cup and a 2-ounce large cup, and another that has a -ounce small cup and a 1-ounce large cup.<br><br> Mixing glass: A classic pint glass usually works just fine, but you can also find a hardy mixing glass designed for this sole purpose.<br><br> Shaker: A Boston shaker is best-the important part is the metal tin. These can have two metal parts, or the large half can be paired with a mixing glass, which is easily replaceable.<br><br> Strainers: A Hawthorne strainer is preferred-it has a flat top affixed to a coiled spring. These are commonly used for straining shaken drinks. "Julep strainers" are round, spoon-shaped strainers with no coil and are generally used for stirred drinks. If you're only going to opt for one for your home bar, however, go with the Hawthorne.<br><br> Bar spoon: These are long, slender spoons that help stir drinks without aerating the liquids too much.<br><br> Muddler: A dense wooden or metal tool used to crush or mix solid ingredients.<br><br> Peeler: A good peeler is a bartender's best friend when crafting the right garnish. A small, sharp knife works, but a Y-shaped peeler with the blade perpendicular to the handle is preferable. Make sure the blade is fresh!<br><br> Fresh Ice: Make sure it tastes and smells, well, like nothing. This is super important. You wouldn't believe how much an ice tray that has been sitting next to your frozen chili for two weeks tastes like two-week-old frozen chili and how much it affects the taste of your drink. (It's definitely a bonus to have ice on the bigger side in most cases, since it melts less quickly and won't water down your drink, but size is nowhere near as important as freshness and purity.)<br><br> Breaking the Glass Ceiling on Glassware<br><br> No need to abide by conformist glassware suggestions! But, hey, just in case, here's a list for reference.<br><br> Rocks/Old Fashioned Glass (can hold 6-8 oz)&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Coupe Glass (5-7 oz)<br><br> Cocktail/Martini Glass (4-5 oz)&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Highball/Collins Glass (10 oz)<br><br> Flute (6 oz)&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Wineglass (Bourdeax or Burgundy/White or Red) (varies)<br><br> Pint Glass (16 oz)&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Hurricane Glass (20 oz)<br><br> Mug (Irish Coffee) (10 oz)&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Cordial or Sherry Glass (4 oz)<br><br> &nbsp;(Brandy) Snifter (12 oz)&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Shot Glass (2 oz)<br><br> Creating Your Perfect Drink<br><br> Most cocktails, as with most everything in life, rely on a certain principle of balance. Begin with the understanding that your alcohol (spirit) is the star of the show. You want to both complement and emphasize its taste with a balance of the sweet (think sweet liqueurs, sugar, vermouth) and the more bold or even harsh flavors (think acidic citrus, bitters, herbal liqueurs). Of course, there are exceptions, but if you stick to this basic framework, it'll be easier not only to remember recipes but to experiment with making your own drinks. A good rule of thumb is that most classic cocktails have between 1 and 3 ounces of total alcohol, in addition to a wide range of other components, mixers, and water.<br><br> Bar Tips<br><br> Learning these simple terms will allow you to understand most basic drinks, streamline your techniques, and sound like a pro when whipping up your favorite cocktails at home.<br><br> "Build": If the cocktail calls for a "shake" or a "stir," you're generally meant to create, or "build," the drink in a separate mixing glass, which is then strained into its preferred glassware. This process helps evenly distribute the ingredients. It's good to get in the habit of building your cocktail using the same order of ingredients each time. I build mine from the bitters on up, which means I start with a dash of bitters (if the recipe calls for it), then the juices or syrups (the less vitally important, or cheaper, ingredients-this is in case you've made a mistake and need to start over; you can't be wasting that precious booze!). And, finally, I finish with the spirit or spirits. Some drinks are simple enough to be built directly in the glass (usually if there are only two parts or it's topped with a fizzy soda that can't be shaken), but others are more complex.<br><br> "Layer": Layered cocktails create a visible layering of ingredients and are often just for appearances. Sometimes the layering or separating of ingredients adds a complexity to the drink, allowing the tastes to evolve and change with each sip. Other times the layered drinks can be stirred after they've made their grand debut.<br><br> "Shake": Any drink that contains fruit juice, dairy, or eggs is generally meant to be shaken. To do this, fill your mixing glass with all ingredients, top with ice, and cover it with the shaker at a slight angle. Then tap the metal shaker with the heel of your hand until the two are sealed. Use both hands (especially if you're a beginner!) to shake it like hell.<br><br> "Stir": All drinks made solely from liquors and syrups should generally be stirred. In a mixing glass, build your cocktail (in the order you're in the habit of-bitters on up for me), fill the glass with ice, and stir gently with a bar spoon for about 15 seconds, until the drink is chilled and the ingredients are dispersed.<br><br> "Strain": Whether you're trying to separate your cocktail from the ice that chilled it, or you're trying to strain out ingredients you may have used while mixing (mint or muddled cherries, for example), using your strainer is key. It also minimizes mess by keeping the contents safe inside your mixing glass. To use a Hawthorne strainer (the one with the coil, which can be found at most kitchen or home-ware stores), place the flexible coils on the inside of the glass until the inner plate is flat on top, hold in place, and pour.<br><br> "Garnish": Often an oversight with home barkeeps, these finishing touches are integral to many drinks. Common garnishes such as lemon, orange, or lime wedges can allow the imbiber to adjust the flavors to their liking. Other garnishes like citrus twists and mint sprigs add a final touch of soft oils and aromas to a drink. Cherries and olives? Eating these is often one of the best parts of Martinis, Manhattans, and the like. Whatever the garnish, don't overlook it!<br><br> Bar Terminology<br><br> Don't be intimidated by all the cocktail jargon spouted out at your local haunt! Here are some of the most useful ways to describe and modify your classic cocktails.<br><br> "Perfect": Believe it or not, there's not just one type of perfect in this world. Different standards of beauty, you say? Yes indeed! You can have a Perfect Martini or Perfect Manhattan. It just means instead of sticking to one type of vermouth (whichever the standard recipe calls for), you use equal parts sweet and dry. Yes, we can have it all!<br><br> "Dry": Less vermouth than the standard recipe calls for. So the less vermouth you use, the drier the Martini is considered to be. This has nothing to do with the type of vermouth being used (dry or sweet), just the amount.<br><br> "Very Dry"/"Extra Dry"/"Bone Dry": Just a whisper of vermouth, if any-a rinse of the glass works just fine. To most, an extra-dry Martini means you can probably just omit the vermouth altogether (when in doubt, just ask your Martini-loving pal to clarify their exact preference).<br><br> "Wet": Refers to the amount, or ratio, of vermouth to spirit. A wet Martini, for example, just refers to more vermouth than the recipe's standard.<br><br> "Dirty": The addition of a splash of olive juice (equal parts with your dry vermouth) to a Martini before mixing.<br><br> "Extra Dirty": The addition of a bigger splash of olive juice to a Martini.<br><br> "Up": In a chilled coupe or Martini glass. (Best if you get all riled "up" and demand your cocktail to be served cold and without ice!)<br><br> "On the Rocks": Served over ice.<br><br> "Neat": Served in a rocks glass with no ice.<br><br> ALCHEMY: Role of bitters, sugar, mixers, syrups, herbs &amp; elixirs. (A nod to the history of alchemy and "stirring things up.")<br><br> Alchemy, essentially, is the process of mixing certain solutions or ingredients together to create or convert matter. Translation? Chemistry . . . or, ahem, cocktail-crafting (some even call it "mixology"), depending on how you look at it. The earliest records of Western female alchemists date back to the third century AD. Mary the Jewess and Cleopatra the Alchemist, allegedly knew the formula to create the Philosopher's Stone, an elixir that could transform mercury into gold and provide longer, healthier lives-even immortality.<br><br> Now, I'm not saying the perfect Rye Manhattan has been known to produce similar results, but I'm also not not saying that. Alchemy is universal and noted in all recorded history, very often associated with the occult and magic. In essence, it's an evolving science of cause and effect; precision as well as improvisation; and sensitivity to the senses.<br><br> Mixing drinks is the same. It's art and science: when you measure correctly and with all variables in place, supposedly you can reproduce a consistent, perfect result. But so much is about experimentation, making mistakes, finding improvements, and personal preference. A Boulevardier probably wouldn't have come about if someone hadn't tried replacing gin with whiskey from one of the most iconic cocktails, the Negroni. Women wouldn't have earned their right to vote if courageous women like Susan B. Anthony hadn't tested and challenged the old-fashioned, unfair, and uncontested laws. Sure, that's not a perfect analogy, but the point is, change comes from observing the status quo, identifying and studying what works and what can be transformed, and then trying like hell to make something different, and maybe even better.<br><br> Bitters, Syrups, Sugars &amp; Concoctions<br><br> Beyond the booze, there exists a dizzying array of modifiers and mixers in the world of bartending. From tiny little dash bottles to sticky-sweet syrups and exotic liquors, we love exploring all means of sprucing up your concoctions. This is by no means a definitive primer but rather an idea of some of the adjuncts you can work with.<br><br> Cocktail Bitters: The most common bitters you'll find (and the staple bottle for your personal bar) are Angostura Aromatic Bitters, though there are countless other brands and flavors available for you to experiment with. Bitters are a super-potent, heavily concentrated, high-alcohol extract of bitter roots, spices, seeds, fruits, and botanicals that are intended to change the flavor of the drink with just a dash or two. But you'd bitter not overdo it, or you may overpower the drink completely!<br><br> Bitter Liqueurs: Similar to cocktail bitters, bitter liqueurs (such as Campari, Amaro, and many herbal liqueurs) come in a wide variety of flavors and colors and are used to round out and enhance many of your drinks.<br><br> Infusions: For the sake of simplicity, we mostly avoid infusions for the classic recipes in this book; however, infusing base spirits with herbs, fruit, or spices is another super-easy way to flaunt your creativity at home. Depending on the potency of your additive, these can take minutes or days to finish . . . another opportunity to taste as you go.<br><br> Syrups: Many drinks call for simple syrup, which is just a fancy way to say sugar water. To make simple syrup, combine boiling hot water with a bunch of sugar. No need to be precise here-around equal parts is fine. White granulated sugar is the most common type used for simple syrup, but using unrefined or raw brown sugars creates a more toffee-like and slightly less sweet syrup. Homemade syrups offer an easy way to try on your alchemy hat and add new and distinct layers to many of the classics.<br><br> Whiskey<br><br> Fighting the Good Fight<br><br> Smash the Good Old Fashioned Patriarchy! (Old Fashioned)<br><br> The Old Fashioned is one of the most iconic and elemental cocktails of all time. In a way, it's an unsophisticated drink by cocktail standards: a simple mix of liquor, sugar, and bitters. But ask any bartender, and they'll tell you its ubiquity does not debase its worth. Hang by a bespoke cocktail bar for a few too many drinks, and you'll fall within earshot of the great debate over what makes for the "perfect Old Fashioned."<br><br> The Old Fashioned may be evocative of men in suits, cigars in hand, behind a smoky curtain in the liquor-forbidden Prohibition years, but it�s also elegant and raw and primed for experimentation within its classic formula. There is a suggestion hidden within this iconic cocktail to look forward, to new perspectives and new flavors. To make the drink your own.<br><br> Throughout history, trailblazing women have considered the status quo, and what came before them, and worked to improve it. They contributed to a new narrative, one that was inclusive. One that was not just composed of those men in suits, cigars in hand; and one that didn�t allow just a single path to achieve a goal. Follow their lead. Learn how to create a classic, or put your own twist on it, but most important, be yourself and make it your own. And smash the patriarchy while you�re at it.<br><br> Now take everything you've just learned and everything you thought you knew and SMASH the compulsion to conform! SMASH a sugar cube with some bitters and water! SMASH any preconceptions of a single right way to make this drink! Establish your own belief system within a historical framework that agrees with your principles and your palate-then SMASH it all together in a glass, and stir yourself a damn good cocktail.<br><br> Gloria Steinem<br><br> Morning Gloria Steinem (Morning Glory)<br><br> A woman without a man is like a fish without a bicycle.<br><br> -Gloria Steinem<br><br> With a career that spans decades, Gloria Steinem is undoubtedly one of America's foremost feminist pioneers and visionaries. She has been both a role model and a lightning rod, depending on the fashion and politics of the time, and has inspired countless women with her eloquent lectures, writing, and action.<br><br> Steinem gained widespread notoriety in 1963 by going undercover as a �Bunny� to expose the mistreatment of women at Playboy Clubs, but her career in journalism continued throughout the 1960s and onward. She was one of the founders of New York magazine, where she wrote a column on politics, penning such pieces as �After Black Power, Women�s Liberation,� and later helped launch Ms. magazine. She said of Ms., �I realized as a journalist that there really was nothing for women to read that was controlled by women,� so in January 1972, Ms. first hit newsstands, featuring, appropriately, Wonder Woman on the cover.</p><h2>Guide to the Most Common Internal Medicine Workups and Diseases: An evidenced based guide for all healthcare providers regarding common hospital based workups and diseases seen in Internal Medicine</h2><p>This guide was created to simplify, yet cover in detail, the most COMMON workups and diseases seen in the field of Internal Medicine.

Born in the Bronx to immigrant parents from Puerto Rico, Sonia found out at age nine that she had diabetes, a serious illness now but an even more dangerous one fifty years ago. How did young Sonia handle the devastating news? She learned to give herself her daily insulin shots and became determined to make the most out of her life. It was the popular sixties TV show <i>Perry Mason</i> that made Sonia want to become a lawyer. Not only a lawyer, but a judge! Her remarkable career was capped in 2009 when President Barack Obama nominated her to the Supreme Court, only the third&nbsp;woman and first Hispanic justice&nbsp;in the court's history. Stories of Sotomayor's career are hardly dry legal stuff&#x2014;she once hopped on a motorcycle to chase down counterfeiters and was the judge whose ruling ended the Major League baseball strike in 1995.</p><p>Megan Stine has written several books for young readers, including <i>Where Is the White House?</i>, <i>Who Was Marie Curie?</i>, <i>Who Was Ulysses S. Grant?, Who Is Michelle Obama?</i>, and Who <i>Was Sally Ride?</i> She lives in Clinton, Connecticut.<br>With strong skills in art and years of experiences in many genres, Dede Putra has developed a career creating illustrations for books, video game development, filmmaking and fashion.<b>Who Is Sonia Sotomayor?</b><br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>New York City: May 25, 2009</b><br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> It was a warm spring day&#x2014;the kind of day to be outside. But Sonia Sotomayor was in her office, sitting beside her phone. She was waiting for the most important call of her life. A call from the White House! She would learn whether President Barack Obama wanted her to be a judge on the Supreme Court.<br> &nbsp;<br> Sonia was already a judge. Her courtroom was in downtown New York City. But being one of the nine judges on the Supreme Court would be very different.<br> &nbsp;<br> The Supreme Court is the most important court in the country&#x2014;it decides whether laws in the United States are fair or not. Its decisions are final.<br> &nbsp;<br> All day the phone in her office rang again and again. Each time Sonia picked it up, it was her family calling. They wanted to know what was happening. If she got the job, she would be only the third woman to sit on the Supreme Court&#x2014;and the very first Hispanic person. Her family would be invited to go to the White House with her the next day. Some family members were coming from Puerto Rico!<br> &nbsp;<br> Finally, at seven o&#x2019;clock that evening, Sonia couldn&#x2019;t stand waiting any longer. She picked up the phone and called the White House herself. She spoke to an aide to the president. What should she do? If she was picked, she had to get to Washington by the next morning.<br> &nbsp;<br> The aide told Sonia to go home and pack&#x2014;and wait for a call.<br> &nbsp;<br> Then, a little after 8:00 p.m., the call came, the one she so hoped for. It was the president. He told her he would name her to be the next associate justice on the Supreme Court!<br> &nbsp;<br> Sonia choked up and started to cry. &#x201c;Thank you, Mr. President,&#x201d; she said.<br> &nbsp;<br> Then he asked her to promise two things. He wanted her to stay the same person that she was&#x2014;and to always stay connected to the world she had come from.<br> &nbsp;<br> For Sonia Sotomayor&#x2014;a girl who had grown up poor and proud of her Puerto Rican heritage&#x2014;that was a promise she was very happy to make.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>Chapter 1: Born in the Bronx</b><br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Sonia Maria Sotomayor was born on June 25, 1954. Her parents, Juan and Celina, brought her home. They lived in a poor area of the Bronx, which is part of New York City. Like many of their neighbors, Juan and Celina had come to the United States from Puerto Rico. They had each left Puerto Rico in 1944, hoping for a better life. In the Bronx, they met and married. They moved into the building where Juan&#x2019;s mother lived.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> The Sotomayors worked hard to make a life in their new country. Celina worked at a hospital while she studied to become a nurse. Juan worked in a factory. Celina learned some English, but the family spoke only Spanish at home.<br> &nbsp;<br> When Sonia was three years old, her brother, Juan, was born. The family called him Junior. With the family growing, her parents decided to move to a bigger, nicer apartment in the Bronx.<br> &nbsp;<br> Sonia liked her new home but missed living near her grandmother Mercedes. Years later, Sonia wrote a book about her life. She called it <i>My Beloved World</i>, and it was published in 2013. In the book, she wrote about her grandmother&#x2014;how full of life she was. She gave parties for the family almost every Saturday night. Everyone danced, played dominoes, and sang. Mercedes read poetry about Puerto Rico and cooked large meals. The apartment would fill with the smell of Puerto Rican food like chicken cooked with onions and garlic. Even as a child, Sonia liked pig&#x2019;s feet and pig&#x2019;s ears!<br> &nbsp;<br> When Sonia was very young, Mercedes began taking her to Puerto Rico for vacations. Sonia loved those trips. She never forgot the clear blue water of the ocean and the white sandy beaches of Puerto Rico.<br> &nbsp;<br> Sonia&#x2019;s father was a sweet man. He took Sonia on picnics, to the beach, and to Yankees games. But he drank too much. Her parents fought a lot because of this.<br> &nbsp;<br> When Sonia&#x2019;s father lost his job, Celina worked nights and weekends to support the family. She also worked to pay for Sonia and Junior to go to a Catholic school. Celina thought education was the most important thing in the world.<br> &nbsp;<br> But Sonia didn&#x2019;t like her school. It was called Blessed Sacrament. The nuns were very strict. They slapped kids who didn&#x2019;t behave.<br> &nbsp;<br> Sonia had other troubles as well. When she was almost eight years old, she fainted in church. And this was not the first sign of a problem. Sonia often had no energy. She was thirsty all the time. She was losing weight. Celina took Sonia to the doctor right away.<br> &nbsp;<br> The doctor sent Sonia to Prospect Hospital in the Bronx for some tests. Celina worked at Prospect Hospital, so Sonia wasn&#x2019;t afraid at first. But when the tests were done, the doctor had bad news. Sonia had type I diabetes. Sonia had never seen her mother cry until that moment.<br> &nbsp;<br> Sonia was scared. She had to stay in the hospital for a week. When she got home from the hospital, Sonia felt better. But there was another problem. As Sonia explained in her book, her parents were nervous about giving her insulin shots. Celina was a nurse, but she hated the idea of hurting Sonia. Her parents started fighting about it.<br> &nbsp;<br> Sonia was always a girl who wanted to solve problems herself. So she climbed up on a chair near the stove to boil water for sterilizing the needle. (Sterilizing means getting rid of germs.)<br> &nbsp;<br> At first her mother was worried. Should she really let a young girl use the stove and handle a needle? Nearly all parents would say absolutely not. But Celina decided to trust her child. From that day on, Sonia gave herself shots of insulin every day.<br> &nbsp;<br> Now that her disease was under control, she had more energy.<br> &nbsp;<br> But the very next year, her world changed again. Her father died suddenly of a heart attack. He was only forty-two years old.<br> &nbsp;<br> Sonia and Junior were very sad, but their mother seemed overcome by grief. Years later, Sonia wrote that her mother wouldn&#x2019;t come out of her room at night. How was a nine-year-old girl supposed to have a happy childhood with so much misery around her?</p><h2>Fingerpower - Level Three: Effective Technic for All Piano Methods (Schaum Publications Fingerpower(R))</h2><p>(Educational Piano).

For every young brown, yellow, and purple dancer, she is an inspiration!&#x201d; &#x2014;Misty Copeland, world-renowned ballet dancer</b><br> &nbsp;<br> Michaela DePrince was known as girl Number 27 at the orphanage, where she was abandoned at a young age and tormented as a &#x201c;devil child&#x201d; for a skin condition that makes her skin appear spotted. But it was at the orphanage that Michaela would find a picture of a beautiful ballerina en pointe that would help change the course of her life.<br> &nbsp;<br> At the age of four, Michaela was adopted by an American family, who encouraged her love of dancing and enrolled her in classes. She went on to study at the Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis School at the American Ballet Theatre and is now the youngest principal dancer with the Dance Theatre of Harlem. She has appeared in the ballet documentary&nbsp;<i>First Position</i>, as well as on&nbsp;<i>Dancing with the Stars, Good Morning America</i>, and&nbsp;<i>Nightline</i>.<br> &nbsp;<br> In this engaging, moving, and unforgettable memoir, Michaela shares her dramatic journey from an orphan in West Africa to becoming one of ballet&#x2019;s most exciting rising stars.<br><br> &#x201c;Michaela DePrince is the embodiment of what it means to fight for your dream.&#x201d; <b>&#x2014;</b>Today<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Michaela DePrince is a role model for girls on and off stage.&#x201d;<b> &#x2014;</b>NYLON</p><p>Michaela DePrince graduated from the American Ballet Theatre&#39;s Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis school in New York, and is a dancer with the Dutch National Ballet. She travels between Amsterdam and New York City, where she lives with her family.Before I was the &#x201c;vile&#x201d; and &#x201c;chilly&#x201d; Odile, I was Michaela DePrince, and before I was Michaela, I was Mabinty Bangura, and this is the story of my flight from war orphan to ballerina.<br><br> In Africa my papa loved the dusty, dry winds of the Harmattan, which blew down from the Sahara Desert every December or January. &#x201c;Ah, the Harmattan has brought us good fortune again!&#x201d; he would exclaim when he returned from harvesting rice. I would smile when he said that because I knew that his next words would be &#x201c;But not as good a fortune as the year when it brought us Mabinty . . . no, never as good as that!&#x201d;<br><br> My parents said that I was born with a sharp cry and a personality as prickly as an African hedgehog. Even worse, I was a girl child--and a spotted one at that, because I was born with a skin condition called vitiligo, which caused me to look like a baby leopard. Nevertheless, my parents celebrated my arrival with joy.<br><br> When my father proclaimed that my birth was the high point of his life, his older brother, Abdullah, shook his head and declared, &#x201c;It is an unfortunate Harmattan that brings a girl child . . . a worthless, spotted girl child, one who will not even bring you a good bride-price.&#x201d; My mother told me that my father laughed at his brother. He and Uncle Abdullah did not see eye to eye on almost anything.<br><br> My uncle was right in one respect: in a typical household in the Kenema District of southeastern Sierra Leone, West Africa, my birth would not have been cause for celebration. But our household was not typical. First of all, my parents&#x2019; marriage had not been arranged. They had married for love, and my father refused to take a second wife, even after several years of marriage, when it appeared that I would be their only child. Secondly, both of my parents could read, and my father believed that his daughter should learn to read as well.<br><br> &#x201c;If my brother is right and no one will wish to marry a girl with skin like the leopard, it is important that our daughter go to school. Let&#x2019;s prepare her for that day,&#x201d; my father told my mother. So he began to teach me the abjad, the Arabic alphabet, when I was just a tiny pikin, barely able to toddle about.<br><br> &#x201c;Fool!&#x201d; Uncle Abdullah sputtered when he saw Papa molding my little fingers around a stick of charcoal. &#x201c;Why are you teaching a girl child? She will think that she is above her station. All she needs to learn is how to cook, clean, sew, and care for children.&#x201d;<br> My spots scared the other children in our village. Nobody would play with me, except my cousins on occasion, so I would often sit alone on the stoop of our hut, thinking. I wondered why my father worked so hard panning for diamonds in the alluvial mines, diamonds that he would not be allowed to keep. It was hard, backbreaking work to stand bent over all day. Papa would hobble home at night, because his back, ankles, and feet ached. His hands would be swollen and painful from sifting the heavy, wet soil through his sieve. Then, one night while Mama was rubbing shea butter mixed with hot pepper into Papa&#x2019;s swollen joints, I overheard a conversation between them, and understood.<br><br> &#x201c;It is important that our daughter go to school to learn more than we are capable of teaching her. I want her to go to a good school.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;If we are frugal, the money from the mines will eventually be enough to pay her school fees, Alhaji,&#x201d; my mother said.<br><br> &#x201c;Ah, Jemi, count the money. How much have we saved so far?&#x201d; Papa asked.<br><br> Mama laughed. &#x201c;This much, plus the amount I counted the last time you asked,&#x201d; she said, holding up the coins he had brought home that evening.<br><br> I smiled a secret smile from my small space behind the curtain. I loved to listen to my parents&#x2019; voices at night. Though I cannot say the same for the voices of Uncle Abdullah and his wives.<br> Our house was set to the right of my uncle&#x2019;s house. Uncle Abdullah had three wives and fourteen children. Much to his unhappiness, thirteen of his children were girls, leaving my uncle and his precious son, Usman, the child of his first wife, as the only males in the household.<br><br> Many nights I would hear cries and shouts of anger drifting across the yard. The sounds of Uncle Abdullah beating his wives and daughters filled my family with sadness. I doubted that Uncle Abdullah ever loved any of his wives, or he would not have beaten them. He certainly didn&#x2019;t love his many daughters. He blamed any and all of his misfortunes on their existence.<br><br> My uncle cared only about his one son. He called Usman his treasure and fed him delicious tidbits of meat while his daughters looked on, hungry and bloated from a starchy diet of rice and cassava, that long, brown-skinned root vegetable that lacks vitamins and minerals. And nothing was more galling to my uncle than finding me outside, sitting cross-legged on a grass mat, studying and writing my letters, which I copied from the Qur&#x2019;an. He could not resist poking me with the toe of his sandal and ordering me to get about the duties of a woman.<br><br> &#x201c;Fool!&#x201d; Uncle Abdullah would sputter at my papa. &#x201c;Put this child to work.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;What need does she have of womanly chores? She is only a child herself,&#x201d; Papa would remind his brother, and then couldn&#x2019;t resist adding: &#x201c;Yes, not even four years old, and yet she speaks Mende, Temne, Limba, Krio, and Arabic. She picks up languages from the marketplace and learns quickly. She will surely become a scholar.&#x201d; Papa didn&#x2019;t need to rub any more salt in Uncle Abdullah&#x2019;s wounds by reminding him that Usman, who was several years older than me, lagged far behind me in his studies.<br><br> &#x201c;What she needs is a good beating,&#x201d; Uncle Abdullah would counter. &#x201c;And that wife of yours, she too needs an occasional beating. You are spoiling your women, Alhaji. No good will ever come of that.&#x201d;<br><br> Perhaps Papa should not have bragged about my learning. The villagers and my uncle thought that I was strange enough with my spots, and my reading made me even stranger in their eyes and made my uncle hate me.<br><br> The only thing that my father and his brother had in common was the land that fed us, sheltered us, and provided the rice, palm wine, and shea butter that we sold at the market.<br><br> At night, when I heard the cries coming from across the yard, I&#x2019;d turn my ear toward my parents resting on the other side of the curtain. From there I heard sweet words of love and soft laughter. Then I would thank Allah because I had been born into the house on the right, rather than the one on the left.</p><h2>101 Popular Songs: for Alto Sax</h2><p>(Instrumental Folio).

It&#x2019;s the middle of April, and we are waiting in a humming line of cars in front of my little sister&#x2019;s day care.</p><p>&#x201c;Wait. Yeah,&#x201d; I say, pushing Pause on <i>Die, Creature, Die</i>, my favorite handheld video game. I am almost at Level Six. &#x201c;What?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I was <i>saying</i>, go inside and sign Alfie out,&#x201d; Mom says. &#x201c;And tell her to hurry, please. I&#x2019;m afraid to turn the engine off. Darn car battery,&#x201d; she adds. I can see the scowl on her face in the rearview mirror. &#x201c;I have to call the auto club when we get home,&#x201d; she says. &#x201c;If we can make it home without having to be towed.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Do I <i>have</i> to get Alfie?&#x201d; I ask, matching Mom&#x2019;s scowl with one of my own. &#x201c;I had a sore throat yesterday. And last time you sent me in there, the little kids made me judge a contest out on the playground. Remember?&#x201d;</p><p>Picture a combination of preschool versions of a TV singing contest and a wrestling match and you&#x2019;ll be close. It was terrible. One kid bit his best friend.</p><p>I&#x2019;m working that sore throat, by the way. It&#x2019;s the reason I didn&#x2019;t walk home from school. Now, of course, I wish I had.</p><p>&#x201c;You have to,&#x201d; Mom tells me, inching our car forward as the line moves. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s not standing by the front door, naturally. Not our Alfie. That would be too easy. She&#x2019;ll be out back with her friends.&#x201d;</p><p>And she <b>REVS</b> the engine a little, as if reminding it what it&#x2019;s supposed to do.</p><p>Kreative Learning and Playtime Day Care is very strict about letting its little kids leave. They either have to be waiting right next to the front door, so the frazzled teacher with the clipboard can check off their names and then watch them go straight out to their car, or you have to walk all the way in and find the right little kid yourself. And then you have to sign them out, but only if you&#x2019;re on the approved list. That means parking the car, though, not waiting in line at the curb. And today, my mom&#x2019;s afraid to turn off our car.</p><p>When I grow up, I want to be so rich that I can buy a new car every time I get close to needing a new battery. Car batteries are boring things to buy.</p><p>&#x201c;EllRay. <i>Move</i>,&#x201d; Mom says, her voice growing sharp.</p><p>And my mom is usually a very quiet lady.</p><p>&#x201c;Okay, okay,&#x201d; I say, turning off my game and sliding it under my backpack so no bad guy can leap into the car and steal it when I&#x2019;m gone.</p><p>It&#x2019;s my favorite thing!</p><p>&#x201c;And make sure Alfie doesn&#x2019;t forget her new pink jacket,&#x201d; Mom tells me.</p><p>&#x201c;She hasn&#x2019;t taken it off in three days,&#x201d; I remind her as I wrestle myself out of my seat belt. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t see how she could forget it.&#x201d;</p><p>And into Kreative Learning and Day Care I go.</p><p>I can&#x2019;t see Alfie anywhere in the main playroom&#x2014; <i>naturally</i>, like my mom said. So I head out back. The whole rear play area is more like a giant cage with a fence around it than it is a playground, only there are so many fun things to do there that the kids don&#x2019;t notice.</p><p>I was hoping my sister would be in the covered patio where the battered playhouse and most of the girls are, but oh, no. And Alfie isn&#x2019;t on the slide or the swings, either. Those are pretty much being swarmed by leftover day care boys, including the kid who bit his friend that other time. A second teacher is trying to keep the boys from clogging up the slide. &#x201c;One at a time!&#x201d; she keeps calling out.</p><p>There&#x2019;s a job I never want to have.</p><p>&#x201c;Alfie!&#x201d; I call out, but she doesn&#x2019;t answer.</p><p>I search the playground with my <b><i>LASER-BEAM EYES</i></b>, the ones I use to score so high <i>in Die, Creature, Die</i>. And there she is with three other girls, over in the far corner of the yard, <i>of course</i>, by the tree, the bush, and the rabbit hutch. Alfie&#x2019;s golden-brown face has a funny expression on it.</p><p>I start to yell for her again, so I won&#x2019;t have to walk all the way over there to get her, but then I stop to watch, because I can&#x2019;t figure out what&#x2019;s going on. At first, it looks like all four girls are playing together. But then I see that it&#x2019;s really <i>three</i> girls who are together, with Alfie on the side, near the hutch. It reminds me of when my mom says, &#x201c;Dressing on the side, please,&#x201d; when she&#x2019;s ordering salad in a restaurant.</p><p>The tallest of the three clumped-together girls is Suzette Monahan, who is a real pain, in my opinion, even though Alfie thinks she&#x2019;s so great. Suzette came over to our house one day, and my mom&#x2019;s still talking about it.</p><p>To say that Suzette is used to getting her own way is putting it mildly.</p><p>Today, Suzette has a long arm slung over each of the other two girls&#x2019; necks. Alfie is turned away from them, staring down at the ground. Her shoulders are slumped. She&#x2019;s kicking at the dirt like that&#x2019;s the most interesting thing in the world to do, and some stuff goes flying through the air.</p><p>And I suddenly remember my old nursery school in San Diego, and the rabbit hutch we had there, and Fuzz-Bunny, who was so kicky and grouchy that no one could even go near him. Hutches use heavy screens instead of regular hard floors on the bottom, so the rabbit poop&#x2014;little pellets&#x2014;just drops down onto the ground, where it&#x2019;s easy for teachers to rake it up. Rabbits&#x2019; tidy poop is probably the only reason they are such popular day-care pets.</p><p>You&#x2019;re not supposed to <i>play</i> with the pellets, though. Or even kick them around.</p><p>And Alfie is usually so easily grossed-out. What&#x2019;s the deal?</p><p>One of the girls who has Suzette&#x2019;s arm hooked around her neck has a fluffy halo of brown hair. She reaches out toward Alfie, and she starts to say something. Alfie turns around. I know that hopeful look on her face, too&#x2014;like it&#x2019;s been raining all Saturday, but the sun just came out.</p><p>But then Suzette yanks away the reaching-out girl, and she whirls both girls around like the three of them are on some lame carnival ride.</p><p>And Alfie is left just standing there.</p><p>Her smile goes behind a cloud. Even her new pink jacket looks sad.</p><p>&#x201c;Rabbit poop girl,&#x201d; Suzette cries, tossing the mean words over her shoulder like a <i>Die, Creature, Die</i> grenade. &#x201c;Stupid pink jacket,&#x201d; she shouts, piling on the insults. &#x201c;Poop jacket!&#x201d; she adds. Then she starts to haul her two captives away.</p><p>And these are Alfie&#x2019;s <i>friends</i>?</p><p>&#x201c;Hey, Alfie,&#x201d; I call out as loud as I can, making sure the other girls can hear me. &#x201c;Mom&#x2019;s waiting out front for us. And we&#x2019;re gonna do something really, really fun! With ice cream at the end of it! After we go shopping for dolls!&#x201d; I add, inspired.</p><p>There. That ought to get &#x2019;em.</p><p>&#x201c;EllWay!&#x201d; Alfie shouts. And she starts running across the playground like she&#x2019;s never been so happy to see anyone in her whole life.</p><p>We&#x2019;re only talking four years so far, but still.</p><p>I am going to have some explaining to do about fun, ice cream, and dolls once Alfie and I are buckled into our sputtering car. But it&#x2019;ll be worth it, seeing the look that&#x2019;s pasted on Suzette Monahan&#x2019;s mean little face right now.</p><p>She&#x2019;s jealous! <i>Good</i>.</p><p>But what is going on here at Kreative Learning and Playtime Day Care?</p><p>Probably nothing, I tell myself as Alfie throws her arms around me, giving me a surprisingly strong hug. Most likely, it was just some stupid game they were playing.</p><p>They were just having <i>fun</i>. Weird girl-fun, but fun. Weren&#x2019;t they?</p><p>And I put the whole thing in another part of my mind as I sign out Alfie and we head for the car.</p><p>Level Six, here I come!</p><p> 2 </p><p>TACO NIGHT</p><p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s up with Alfie?&#x201d; I ask my mom a week later, after a perfect dinner of tacos, tacos, and more tacos. This happened because tonight was Taco Night, a popular new tradition on Wednesdays in my family. And then we had applesauce. It is my turn to help with the dishes, but instead of Alfie sticking around and pestering Mom and me, like she usually does, she has slumped off to her bedroom like a sad little comma with a dark cloud over its head.</p><p>My third grade teacher Ms. Sanchez said today that commas are our friends, because they break up long sentences and make them easier to understand. But I&#x2019;m a short sentence guy.</p><p>I&#x2019;m eight years old, and we live in Oak Glen, California. I go to Oak Glen Primary School, and as you already know, Alfie goes to Kreative Learning and Playtime Day Care, &#x201c;<i>featuring computer skills and potty training</i>,&#x201d; my dad always likes to read from the big sign out front. He has almost stopped complaining about how they spelled &#x201c;creative&#x201d; wrong, because what&#x2019;s the point?</p><p>They must think it&#x2019;s cute, Mom says.</p><p>Alfie goes to day care because Dad teaches about rocks in a San Diego college all day, and my mom writes fantasy books for grown-up ladies.</p><p>That fantasy book thing is why Alfie and I have such unusual&#x2014;okay, <b>WEIRD</b>&#x2014;names, by the way. &#x201c;Alfie&#x201d; is short for &#x201c;Alfleta,&#x201d; which means &#x201c;beautiful elf&#x201d; in some ancient language hardly anyone speaks anymore.

The 3rd-grade overlap between the two books signifies the time when students transition from learning to read to reading to learn. It's a significant shift that if bungled can leave a child with serious educational and social deficits.</p><p>In his first book, Blevins identified children at being high-risk for reading difficulties as: limited exposure to books, low socioeconomic families, below-average intelligence, limited development of oral language, and English as a second language. For some children, the deck is already stacked against reading success. If we add insufficient teacher readiness to the list, the negative consequences are multiplied. In fact, a 2015 study found that only 36% of fourth-graders (in the U.S.) read at or above the proficient level.</p><p>Getting teachers the training and tools (like this guide and a fully stocked library) they need to turn even at-risk students into readers is vital. Educators who understand and teach phonics and word study can have a big impact on their students' reading success. Like in his first work, Blevins offers terrific explanations, context, examples, strategies, and activities. He has a way of making language feel electric and dynamic.</p><p>Educators and even parents will benefit from careful and repeated reading of this work." --Melanie Gilbert<br><br><i>Provided via Amazon Vine</i></p><br><br><p>"This is a great supplement for my struggling student.

After the Reys escaped Paris by bicycle in 1940 carrying the manuscript for the original&nbsp;<i>Curious George</i>, the book was published in America in 1941. More than 200 Curious George titles followed, with 75 million books sold&nbsp;worldwide. Curious George has been successfully adapted into a major motion picture and an Emmy-winning television show on&nbsp;PBS.<br> &nbsp;</p><br><br>The Reys were born in Hamburg, Germany. <b>Hans Augusto Rey</b> (1898-1977) met his wife-to-be, <b>Margret</b> (1906-1996), at a party in her father&#x2019;s home in Germany; when he first caught a glimpse of her, she was sliding down the banister. In their twenties and thirties they lived in Paris and in Rio de Janeiro, where Hans sold bathtubs in villages along the Amazon River. Eventually Cambridge, Massachusetts, became the Reys&#x2019; home and community. Throughout their lives the Reys created many lively books together, including SPOTTY, PRETZEL, and lift-the-flap books such as HOW DO YOU GET THERE? The manuscript of the first Curious George books was one of the few items the Reys carried with them on their bicycles when they escaped from Paris in 1940. Eventually, they made their way to the United States, and CURIOUS GEORGE was published in 1941. Their incorrigible little monkey has become an American icon, selling millions of books and capturing the hearts of readers everywhere. CURIOUS GEORGE has been published in many languages, including French, German, Japanese, Afrikaans, and Norwegian.

Curious George is a guest at a Hanukkah party, where he sees children make jelly doughnuts, plays dreidel, and watches the Man in the Yellow Hat light the menorah. He helps make latkes, plays follow the leader, assists with cleanup, and wraps up a treat for a sick friend. The reasons behind most of the activities are not provided, e.g., the lighting of the menorah is described, but the reason behind it isn't given, making this book more suited to children who already know about the holiday.

Others confront our epidemic of anxiety with fierce resistance, or "the fight to be right," criticizing anyone and everyone just to end up stuck.<br><br>In the face of such pervasive human suffering, New York Times best-selling author and legendary life coach Iyanla Vanzant challenges us: What if it's not them--what if it's you? What if you need to "get over it"--and get over yourself? Because no matter how much we would like to blame people and circumstances beyond our control, the truth is staggeringly simple: anything and everything we experience is a function of what and how we think. In Get Over It! Iyanla offers a unique spiritual technology called "thought therapy," a process that harnesses proven spiritual tools with the science of neuroplasticity. The 42 prayers and affirmations, and complementary energy-clearing tools at the heart of the thought therapy process are designed to neutralize and eliminate the unconscious, unproductive, soul-destroying dominant negative thought patterns (DNTPs) and discordant emotional energies, allowing you to get to the root cause of your personal suffering, and make life-affirming choices.<br><br>If you're ready to break free of your ego's resistance and willing to face yourself, willing to change, and willing to heal and grow--then now's the time to Get Over It!</p><p><b>Iyanla Vanzant</b> is one of the country's most celebrated writers and public speakers, and she's among the most influential, socially engaged, and acclaimed spiritual life coaches of our time.

The girl, though, thinks that no matter how sour they sound, there&#x2019;s no family sweet as hers.

She worked in advertising before deciding to pursue her passion for illustration.</p>"PreS-K-For many, the ideas of privilege and allyship are concepts that are not explicitly taught in childhood. Many people must consciously unlearn the system of beliefs imposed by parents, authority figures, and the overall dominant culture. Ewing's colorful, sunny board book takes such nebulous ideas and packages them into an easily digestible vocabulary bank for young readers. While definitions have been simplified to two sentences, Ewing doesn't avoid or ignore the far-reaching impact of these words. For example, the difference between "Gender" and "Sex" is clearly and objectively explained. She writes, "Gender is a category that describes the inside feeling of being a boy, girl, both, neither, and everything in between." Ewing defines the term sex as, "When a baby arrives, the doctor will say it's a boy or girl depending on their understanding of the baby's body. This is their sex." Each letter of the alphabet and its corresponding word is accompanied by a related image. Morgan's illustrations feature cartoon children and adults of various skin tones and physical abilities and exude joyful acceptance.VERDICT Ewing offers the tools of understanding and reciprocity in order to eradicate injustice. Highly recommended for school and public libraries and can serve as an entry point into social justice literature."&nbsp;- <b><i>School Library Journal</i></b> <br><br>"Gleeful characters combined with flowers and striking colors bring personality to each page with each letter of the alphabet representing a societal idea. The letter "A," for example, stands for "ability," and is juxtaposed with a depiction of a child in a wheelchair, one young girl with a guitar, and another with a wrench and paintbrush. The illustrations and words expand upon the uniqueness that comes with these various abilities. Each concept is meant to spark a conversation between parents and their young children, but with simple terminology and even easier definitions."&nbsp;<b><i>- Blavity</i></b></p><h2>The Type 1 Diabetes Cookbook: Easy Recipes for Balanced Meals and Healthy Living</h2><p><p><strong><em>The Type 1 Diabetes Cookbook</em> is the definitive cookbook to take control of your diabetes with easy, everyday recipes.</strong></p><p>A balanced diet is the key to stability and good health with type 1 diabetes. <em>The Type 1 Diabetes Cookbook</em> offers the easiest recipes to keep blood sugars steady and allow you to thrive with type 1 diabetes.</p><p>Laurie Block, MS, RDN, CDE, a registered dietitian and certified diabetes educator with over 30 years of experience, makes it easy to get well-balanced meals on the table with recipes that feature 10 or fewer easy-to-find ingredients.

Outnumbered forty to one, they pursued the enemy army across the mountainous Afghanistan terrain and, after a series of intense battles, captured the city of Mazar-i-Sharif, which was strategically essential to defeat their opponent throughout the country.<br> <br>The bone-weary American soldiers were welcomed as liberators as they rode into the city, and the streets thronged with Afghans overjoyed that the Taliban regime had been overthrown.<br> <br>Then the action took a wholly unexpected turn. During a surrender of six hundred Taliban troops, the Horse Soldiers were ambushed by the would-be POWs. Dangerously overpowered, they fought for their lives in the city&#x2019;s immense fortress, Qala-i-Janghi, or the House of War. At risk were the military gains of the entire campaign: if the soldiers perished or were captured, the entire effort to outmaneuver the Taliban was likely doomed.<br> <br>Deeply researched and beautifully written, Stanton&#x2019;s account of the Americans&#x2019; quest to liberate an oppressed people touches the mythic. The soldiers on horses combined ancient strategies of cavalry warfare with twenty-first-century aerial bombardment technology to perform a seemingly impossible feat. Moreover, their careful effort to win the hearts of local townspeople proved a valuable lesson for America&#x2019;s ongoing efforts in Afghanistan.</p><p>Doug Stanton is the author of the <i>New York Times </i>bestsellers <i>In Harm&#x2019;s Way: The Sinking of the USS </i><i>Indianapolis and the Extraordinary Story of Its Survivors </i>and <i>Horse Soldiers: The Extraordinary Story of a Band of US Soldiers Who Rode to Victory in Afghanistan</i>, which is the basis for a Jerry Bruckheimer&#x2013;produced movie by the same name, starring Chris Hemsworth and Michael Shannon, to be released by Warner Bros. in 2018.

Trouble rolled past the refugee camp, past the tattered tents shuddering in the moonlight, the lone cry of a baby driving high into the sky, like a nail. Sunrise was no better; at sunrise, trouble was still there, bristling with AKs and RPGs, engines idling, waiting to roll into the city. Waiting. </p><p> These were the baddest of the bad, the real masters of mayhem, the death dealers with God stamped firmly in their minds. The city groaned and shook to life. Soon everyone knew trouble had arrived at the gates of the city. </p><p> Major Mark Mitchell heard the news at headquarters nine miles away and thought, <i>You're kidding. We got bad guys at the wire?</i> </p><p> He ran downstairs, looking for Master Sergeant Dave Betz. Maybe he would know what was happening. </p><p> But Betz didn't know anything. He blustered, "One of the Agency guys came down and told us we got six hundred Taliban surrendering. Can you believe that?" </p><p> Surrendering? Mitchell couldn't figure out why. He thought the Taliban had fled from the approaching forces of the Northern Alliance to Konduz, miles away. American Special Forces and the Northern Alliance had been beating them back for weeks, in battle after battle, rolling up territory by coordinating airstrikes from the sky and thousands of Northern Alliance soldiers on the ground. </p><p> They now stood on the verge of total victory. Konduz was where the war was supposed to go next. Not here. Not in Mazar. Not at Club Mez. </p><p> Besides, these guys didn't <i>surrender.</i> They fought to the death. </p><p> Die fighting and you went to paradise. <br> </p><p> Mitchell stood at the dirty plate-glass windows and watched. Here they came, a motley crew of the doomed, packed into six big trucks, staring out from the rancid tunnels of their scarves. Mitchell could see their heads over the barricade that ringed his headquarters, a former schoolhouse at the junk-strewn edge of the city. The prisoners -- who surely included some Al Qaeda members -- were still literally in the drivers' seats, with Northern Alliance soldiers sitting next to them, their AKs pointed at the drivers' heads. The prisoners turned and stared and Mitchell thought it was like looking at hundreds of holes punched in a wall. </p><p> "Everybody get away from the windows!" said Betz. </p><p> Major Kurt Sonntag, Captain Kevin Leahy, Captain Paul Syverson, and a dozen other Special Forces soldiers knelt behind the black and white checked columns in the room, their M-4 rifles aimed at the street. Behind them, in the kitchen, the local cook was puttering -- the air smelled of cooked rice and cucumber -- and a radio was playing more of that god-awful Afghan music that sounded to Mitchell like somebody strangling a goose. </p><p> He had been looking forward this morning to overseeing the construction of the medical facility in town, and the further blowing up of mines and bombs that littered the area like confetti. Each day, a little bit more of the war seemed to be ending. Mitchell had even started to wonder when he would get to go home. He and a team of about a dozen Special Forces soldiers had moved into the schoolhouse only forty-eight hours earlier. Their former headquarters inside the Qala-i-Janghi Fortress, nine miles off, in Mazar's western quarter, had given them the shits, the croup, and the flu, and Mitchell was glad to have moved out. It seemed a haunted place. Known as the House of War, the fortress rose like a mud golem from the desert, surrounded by struggling plots of wind-whipped corn and sparse cucumber. Its walls towered sixty feet high and measured thirty feet thick under the hard, indifferent sun. </p><p> The Taliban had occupied the fortress for seven years and filled it with weapons -- grenades, rockets, and firearms, anything made for killing. Even Enfield rifles with dates stamped on the bayonets -- 1913 -- from the time that the Brits had occupied the area. Before their hurried flight from the city two weeks earlier, the Taliban had left the weapons and smeared feces on the walls and windows. Every photograph, every painting, every rosebush had been torn up, smashed, stomped, ruined. Nothing beautiful had been left behind. </p><p> After three years of Taliban rule, there were old men in Mazar with stumps for hands. There were women who'd been routinely stoned and kicked on street corners. Young men who'd been imprisoned for not wearing beards. Fathers who'd been beaten in front of their sons for the apparent pleasure of those swinging their weapons. </p><p> The arrival of Mitchell and his soldiers on horseback had put an end to that. The people of Mazar-i-Sharif, the rugmakers and butchers, the car mechanics and schoolteachers, the bank clerks and masons and farmers, had thrown flowers and kisses and reached up to the Americans on their horses and pulled affectionately at the filthy cuffs of their camo pants. The locals had welcomed the balding, blue-eyed Mitchell and two dozen other Special Forces soldiers in a mile-long parade lining the highway that dropped into town out of the snowy mountains. Mitchell had felt like he was back in World War II, his grandfather's war, riding into Paris after the Nazis fled. </p><p> Now thirty-six, Mitchell was the ground commander of the Fifth Special Forces Group/Third Battalion's Forward Operating Base (FOB). It had been a distinguished nearly fifteen-year career headed for the top of the military food chain. His best friend, Major Kurt Sonntag, a thirty-seven-year-old former weekend surfer from Los Angeles, was the FOB's executive officer, which technically meant he was Mitchell's boss. In the tradition of Special Forces, they treated each other as equals. Nobody saluted, including less senior officers like Captain Kevin Leahy and Captain Paul Syverson, members of the support company whose job it was to get the postwar operations up and running, such as providing drinking water, electricity, and medical care to the locals. </p><p> Looking at the street now, Mitchell tried to figure out why the Taliban convoy was stopping. If anything went bad, Mitchell knew he was woefully outnumbered. He had maybe a dozen guys he could call on. And those like Leahy and Syverson weren't exactly hardened killers. Like him, these were staff guys, in their mid-thirties, soldiers who had until now been largely warless. He did have a handful of CIA operators living upstairs in the schoolhouse and eight Brits, part of a Special Boat Service unit who'd landed the night before by Chinook helicopter, but they were so new that they didn't have orders for rules of engagement -- that is, it wasn't clear to them when they could and could not return fire. Doing the math, Mitchell roughly figured that he had about a dozen guys available to fight. The trained-up fighters, the two Special Forces teams that Mitchell had ridden into town with, had left earlier in the day for Konduz, for the expected fight there. Mitchell had watched them drive away and felt that he was missing out on a chance to make history. He'd been left behind to run the headquarters office and keep the peace. Now, after learning that 600 Taliban soldiers had massed outside his door, he wondered if he'd been dead wrong. </p><p> The street bustled with beeping taxis; with donkeys hauling loads of handmade bricks to the city-center bazaar; with aged men gliding by on wobbling bicycles and women ghosting through the rising dust in blue burkhas. <i>Afghanistan.</i> Never failed to amaze him. </p><p> Still the convoy hadn't moved. Ten minutes had passed. </p><p> Without warning, a group of locals piled toward the trucks, angrily grabbing at the prisoners. They got hold of one man and pulled him down -- for a moment he was there, gripping the battered wooden side of the truck, and then he was gone, snatched out of sight. Behind the truck, out of sight, they were beating the man to death. </p><p> Every ounce of rage, every rape, every public execution, every amputation, humiliation -- every ounce of revenge was poured back into this man, slathered on by fist, by foot, by gnarled stick. The trucks lurched ahead and when they moved on, nothing remained of the man. It was as if he'd been eaten. </p><p> The radio popped to life. Mitchell listened as a Northern Alliance commander, who was stationed on the highway, announced in broken English: <i>The prisoners all going to Qala-i-Janghi.</i> </p><p> Remembering the enormous pile of weapons cached at the fortress, Mitchell didn't want to hear this. But his hands were tied. The Afghan commanders of the Northern Alliance were, as a matter of U.S. strategy, calling the shots. No matter the Americans' might, this was the Afghans' show. Mitchell was in Mazar to "assist" the locals in taking down the Taliban. He figured he could get on a radio and suggest to the Afghan commander presiding over the surrender that the huge fortress would not be an ideal place to house six hundred angry Taliban and Al Qaeda soldiers. But maybe there was a good reason to send them there. As long as the prisoners were searched and guarded closely, maybe they could be held securely within the fort's towering mud walls. </p><p> And then Mitchell thought again of the weapons stockpiled at Qala-i-Janghi, the piles and piles of rockets, rifles, crates of ammo -- tons of violence ready to be put to use. </p><p> <i>Not the fort, he thought. Not the damn fort!</i> <br> </p><p> Belching smoke, grinding gears, the convoy of prisoners rumbled past the fortress's dry moat and through the tall, arched entrance. The prisoners in the trucks craned around like blackbirds on a wire, scanning the walls, looking for guards, looking for an easy way out. </p><p> In deference to the Muslim prohibition against men touching other men intimately, few of the prisoners had been thoroughly searched. No hand had reached deep inside the folds of their thin gray gowns, the mismatched suit coats, the dirty khaki vests, s...</p></p><h2>Rick Steves Best of Spain (Rick Steves Travel Guide)</h2><p><b>Hit Spain's can't-miss art, sights, and bites in two weeks or less with <i>Rick Steves Best of Spain</i>!</b><ul><li><b>Strategic advice</b> from Rick Steves on what's worth your time and money</li><li><b>Short itineraries</b> covering Barcelona, Madrid, Toledo, Granada, Andaluc�a's White Hill Towns, and Sevilla</li><li><b>Rick's tips</b> for beating the crowds, skipping lines, and avoiding tourist traps</li><li><b>The best of local culture, flavors, and haunts,</b> including <b>insightful walks</b> through museums, historic sights, and atmospheric neighborhoods</li><li><b>Trip planning strategies </b>like how to link destinations and design your itinerary, what to pack, where to stay, and how to get around</li><li><b>Over 400 full-color pages </b>with detailed maps and vibrant photos throughout</li><li><b>Suggestions for side trips </b>to Montserrat and Figueres, Basque Country, Santiago de Compostela, El Escorial, Segovia, Salamanca, C�rdoba, and Spain's South Coast</li></ul><b>Experience Spain's old world romance and new world excitement for yourself with <i>Rick Steves Best of Spain</i>!</b><br>Planning a longer trip? <i>Rick Steves Spain 2020</i> is the classic, in-depth guide to exploring the country, updated annually.</p><p>Since 1973, <b>Rick Steves</b> has spent about four months a year exploring Europe.

He can still picture once being happy and safe, but memories of those days are fading as he and his family face the dangers threatening Jews in Hitler&#39;s Germany in the late 1930&#39;s. No longer able to practice their religion, vote, own property, or even work, Daniel&#39;s family is forced from their home in Frankfurt and sent on a long and dangerous journey, first to the Lodz ghetto in Poland, and then to Auschwitz -, the Nazi death camp. Though many around him lose hope in the face of such terror, Daniel, supported by his courageous family, struggles for survival. He finds hope, life and even love in the midst of despair.</p><p>Carol is the award-winning author of many historical novels for young people, including Greater than Angels,<br>The Garden, After the War, Lisa, Daniel's Story, and Rebecca.

Carol has also written acclaimed contemporary, science fiction and fantasy novels. She lives in Winnipeg, Manitoba.A fictional account of a Jewish boy in Germany in the late 1930s, DANIEL'S STORY was first published as part of an exhibit at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. Its origin lends authenticity to this compelling, chilling story. Although narrator Daniel Carpenter-Gold's pitch is right for the voice of a teenage boy, his delivery is mediocre. The level of drama is uneven; at times it's too forceful for a younger listening audience. Further, the excess drama somewhat distracts from the important story told in the voice of young Daniel. Regardless, these shortfalls should not prevent listeners from taking advantage of this opportunity to learn more about a difficult time in history, especially one that is shared from such a unique point of view.

Henry was standing with his back against the front door, pale and rigid, his left hand pressed to his neck. Blood was seeping between his fingers, running down his wrist and dripping from his elbow onto the back of Jacob&#x2019;s head. Jacob was facedown on the tiled floor, arms outstretched to either side with blood pooling around his wrists.

Drawing inspiration from the shells on the shore, Lindbergh&#x2019;s musings on the shape of a woman&#x2019;s life bring new understanding to both men and women at any stage of life. A mother of five, an acclaimed writer and a pioneering aviator, Lindbergh casts an unsentimental eye on the trappings of modernity that threaten to overwhelm us: the time-saving gadgets that complicate rather than simplify, the multiple commitments that take us from our families. And by recording her thoughts during a brief escape from everyday demands, she helps readers find a space for contemplation and creativity within their own lives.<br><br> With great wisdom and insight Lindbergh describes the shifting shapes of relationships and marriage, presenting a vision of life as it is lived in an enduring and evolving partnership. A groundbreaking, best-selling work when it was originally published in 1955, <i>Gift from the Sea </i>continues to be discovered by new generations of readers. With a new introduction by Lindbergh&#x2019;s daughter Reeve, this fiftieth-anniversary edition will give those who are revisiting the book and those who are coming upon it for the first time fresh insight into the life of this remarkable woman.<br><br> The sea and the beach are elements that have been woven throughout Anne Morrow Lindbergh&#x2019;s life. She spent her childhood summers with her family on a Maine island. After her marriage to Charles Lindbergh in 1929, she accompanied him on his survey flights around the North Atlantic to launch the first transoceanic airlines. The Lindberghs eventually established a permanent home on the Connecticut coast, where they lived quietly, wrote books and raised their family.<br><br> After the children left home for lives of their own, the Lindberghs traveled extensively to Africa and the Pacific for environmental research. For&nbsp;several years they lived on the island of Maui in Hawaii, where Charles Lindbergh died in 1974.&nbsp;<br><br> Anne Morrow Lindbergh spent her final years in her Connecticut home, continuing her writing projects and enjoying visits from her children and grand-children. She died on February 7, 2001, at the age&nbsp;of ninety-four.<br><br> Reeve Lindbergh is the author of many books for both adults and children, including the memoirs <i>Under a Wing</i> and <i>No More Words.</i></p><p><b>Anne Morrow Lindbergh</b>&nbsp;was born in 1906. She married Charles Lindbergh in 1929 and became a noted aviator in her own right, eventually publishing several books on the subject and receiving several aviation awards.&nbsp;<i>Gift from the Sea</i>,&nbsp;published in 1955, earned her international acclaim. She was inducted into the National Aviation Hall of Fame, the National Women's Hall of Fame, and the Aviation Hall of Fame of New Jersey.&nbsp;<i>War Within and Without</i>,&nbsp;the penultimate installment of her published diaries, received the Christopher Award in 1980. Mrs. Lindbergh died in 2001 at the age of ninety-four.I began these pages for myself, in order to think out my own particular pattern of living, my own individual balance of life, work and human relationships. And since I think best with a pencil in my hand, I started naturally to write. I had the feeling, when the thoughts first clarified on paper, that my experience was very different from other people&#x2019;s. (Are we all under this illusion?) My situation had, in certain ways, more freedom than that of most people, and in certain other ways, much less.<br><br>Besides, I thought, not all women are searching for a new pattern of living, or want a contemplative corner of their own. Many women are content with their lives as they are. They manage amazingly well, far better than I, it seemed to me, looking at their lives from the outside. With envy and admiration, I observed the porcelain perfection of their smoothly ticking days. Perhaps they had no problems, or had found the answers long ago. No, I decided, these discussions would have value and interest only for myself. <br><br>But as I went on writing and simultaneously talking with other women, young and old, with different lives and experiences&#x2014;those who supported themselves, those who wished careers, those who were hard-working housewives and mothers, and those with more ease&#x2014;I found that my point of view was not unique. In varying settings and under different forms, I discovered that many women, and men too, were grappling with essentially the same questions as I, and were hungry to discuss and argue and hammer out possible answers. Even those whose lives had appeared to be ticking imperturbably under their smiling clock-faces were often trying, like me, to evolve another rhythm with more creative pauses in it, more adjustment to their individual needs, and new and more alive relationships to themselves as well as others.<br><br>And so gradually, these chapters, fed by conversations, arguments and revelations from men and women of all groups, became more than my individual story, until I decided in the end to give them back to the people who had shared and stimulated many of these thoughts. Here, then, with my warm feelings of gratitude and companionship for those working along the same lines, I return my gift from the sea.</p><h2>Dream Big: Michael Jordan and the Pursuit of Excellence</h2><p><b>Olympic dreams come true in this inspiring picture book from Michael Jordan&#x2019;s mother, author of the </b><b><i>New York Times </i></b><b>bestselling <i>Salt in His Shoes</i>.</b><br><br>Long before he became a professional All-Star basketball player, Michael Jordan had dreams of winning an Olympic gold medal&#x2014;and with dedication and perseverance, that&#x2019;s exactly what he did.

He lives with his family in Quarryville, Pennsylvania.Michael Jordan's mother returns for another story about her famous son's childhood. <br> Michael Jordan s childhood dreams were always of playing basketball. His friends, brothers and mother are full of upbeat advice, encouraging him to work hard and keep practicing. After watching the U.S. Olympic team battle Russia, young Michael announces to his mother that he will be an Olympic basketball champion. More pat advice about dreamers and doers follows. But Michael puts his plan into action by asking his coach what he could do now to get closer to that dream. And in an ending that echoes Salt in His Shoes (cowritten with Roslyn Jordan and illustrated by Kadir Nelson, 2000), he goes to his older brother s scrimmage and makes a three-pointer right over the heads of his opponents. An afterword sums up Michael s journey to the Olympic Games the culmination of lots of little steps undertaken day after day. -- Kirkus<br><br>This inspirational story focuses on the outside influences surrounding the athlete as a nine-year-old both at home and abroad. When the American basketball team loses its bid for a gold medal to Russia in the 1972 Olympics, young Jordan is watching, along with his brothers. Inspired by the close game, he informs his mother that he is going to be an Olympic champion. Through bits and pieces of conversation and parental admonitions, he learns how to achieve his goal with a series of small steps. He is called a dreamer, but proves that he is a doer as well. His mother, his middle-school coach, his brother Larry, and a friend all contribute their words of wisdom that lead him to work toward his goal. The watercolor and gouache illustrations have a warm, almost golden tone that evoke the hovering, seemingly present gold medal. In the author s note, readers learn that Jordan achieved his goal in 1984. A timely publication just before the 2012 Olympics, this book could be paired with the author s previous story about her son, Salt in His Shoes (S &amp; S, 2000).

(Where Is?)</h2><p><b>Armchair adventurers can set sail for the remote Galapagos Islands and learn about the strange and unique animals that live there.&nbsp;<br><br></b>The Galapagos Islands are a chain of volcanic islands located on either side of the equator in the Pacific Ocean. The isolated location of the islands has allowed a vast number of species to develop that are original to each island, such as the marine iguana, the blue-footed booby, the magnificent&nbsp;frigatebird and of course the giant Galapagos tortoise, which may live to be over one hundred years old. Studied by Charles Darwin during his historic voyage on the <i>HMS Beagle</i>, the island life contributed to his groundbreaking theory of evolution. Today the islands are a popular tourist destination and a UNESCO World Heritage site.<br><br>This book, part of the <i>New York Times </i>best-selling series, is enhanced by eighty illustrations and a detachable fold-out map complete with four photographs on the back.</p><p>Megan Stine has written several books for young readers, including <i>Where Is the White House?</i>, <i>Who Was Marie Curie?</i>, and <i>Who Was Sally Ride?</i> She lives in Clinton, Connecticut.<b>Where Are the Galapagos Islands?</b><br> &nbsp;<br> It was a hot, dry day in March. The year was 1535. Brother Tomas, the bishop of Panama, was on board a ship sailing from Panama to Peru. He had been sent by King Charles I of Spain to settle problems in Peru. (Spain owned Peru at that time.) The bishop thought there was enough food and water for the trip, but he was wrong. After seven days at sea, the wind suddenly died down. His ship was stranded in the Pacific Ocean. There was no way other than wind to make the ship move&#x2014;motors didn&#x2019;t exist yet. He could do nothing but wait until the wind picked up again to fill the sails. For several days, the ship drifted on the ocean currents. The men on board were so thirsty, they thought they might die. They couldn&#x2019;t drink the salty seawater&#x2014;it would have killed them. Finally, on March 10, they spotted land. Islands! They had drifted toward an amazing place that wasn&#x2019;t on any map. No one lived on these islands. No one even knew these islands existed!<br> &nbsp;<br> Quickly they anchored the boat. The bishop and crew went ashore, hoping to find food and water.<br> &nbsp;<br> What they saw seemed like a cross between heaven and hell on earth.<br> &nbsp;<br> The islands were alive with animals the sailors had never seen before. There were giant tortoises big enough for a man to ride! There were iguanas that knew how to dive and swim! There were hundreds of strange birds that weren&#x2019;t afraid of people. They would perch on a sailor&#x2019;s head, or hop right onto his hand. Some birds had bright blue feet and walked in a funny waddle.<br> &nbsp;<br> But there was no freshwater to be found. When the bishop&#x2019;s men dug a well, the water that came out was saltier than the ocean. And much of the landscape was so rocky and harsh, plants could not grow. On some islands, the land was covered with solid black lava&#x2014;sharp to the touch and difficult to walk on. The bishop said it looked like &#x201c;God had showered stones.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> All the men had to eat were sour prickly cactuses. They sucked the liquid out of them to survive. The bishop and his men searched several of the islands, but two men and some horses died of thirst before they could find any freshwater to drink. When a breeze finally blew in after two days, they quickly reboarded the ship and sailed away.<br> &nbsp;<br> The bishop didn&#x2019;t give a name to the islands. But he did write to the king of Spain, describing this otherworldly place. He mentioned the giant tortoises, called gal�pagos in Spanish. The islands appeared on a map a few years later with that name&#x2014;Galapagos.<br> &nbsp;<br> It would take another 150 years before anyone visited again or wrote about this strange, magical place. And it would be exactly three hundred years till the most famous visitor of all arrived&#x2014;a young scientist named Charles Darwin. When he landed on the Galapagos and saw the creatures there, he came up with an idea about how all forms of life change over time. His big idea&#x2014; called evolution&#x2014;changed the world. Because of Darwin, the Galapagos Islands became the famous place they are today.</p><h2>Choose Your Own Adventure 6-Book Boxed Set #2 (Race Forever, Escape, Lost on the Amazon, Prisoner of the Ant People, Trouble on Planet Earth, War with the Evil Power Master)</h2><p>This 6-book boxed set of interactive, children's classics includes 6 books from the Choose Your Own Adventure series: <b>Race Forever</b> * <b>Escape</b> * <b>Lost on the Amazon</b> * <b>Prisoner of the Ant People</b> * <b>Trouble on Planet Earth</b> * <b>War With the Evil Power Master</b>.<b></b><br><b></b><br><b>Widely commended for its appeal to reluctant readers, Choose Your Own Adventure is the 4th bestselling book series for children of all time.</b><br><br>These books are different from other books you've read before.

Their unusual journey is described in lyrical verse, creating a enchanting story that celebrates the serene beauty of the world at night.</p><p>Carolyn Curtis has previously worked as an attendant at an animal hospital, a nanny and most recently as a member services co-ordinator at a non-profit parenting organisation. She graduated from Emerson College in Boston, MA with a BS in Mass Communication, and her writing is inspired by the many children she has spent time with. Carolyn loves nature, children, animals, reading and music. She lives in Massachusetts with her husband and two year-old son. Alison Jay lives and works in London. A graduate in illustration from the London College of Printing, Alison has been illustrating children&#39;s books for ten years. To create her unique style, she uses alkyd oil paint on paper with a crackling varnish, which gives her illustrations a unique, nostalgic quality. I Took the Moon for a Walk is Alison&#39;s first title for Barefoot Books. Her other picture books include ABC, A Child&#39;s First Picture Book (2003); A Ladder to the Stars (2003) and The Race (2002).Kindergarten-Grade 3&#x2013;Curtis's charming rhyme begins, "I took the Moon for a walk last night./It followed behind like a still summer kite,/Though there wasn't a string or a tail in sight/when I took the Moon for a walk." The child's journey continues over a bridge, past a sharp steeple that nearly snags the moon, through a pack of howling dogs, and across the dewy grass. Throughout, the language is fresh and visual: "rust-bellied robins," "neighborhood dogs made a train-whistle choir," "clouds that were fragile as lace." The book ends with two pages of facts about the phases of the moon and some of the animals and plants included in the story. The folk-art-inspired illustrations are a perfect complement to the gentle fantasy. Using oil painted on paper with a crackling varnish, Jay creates a moving, panoramic country landscape in which the pictures tell many stories that children will love to discover&#x2013;the skinny-legged moon loses a slipper; the neighborhood dogs run out for an evening romp; a gentleman pedals by on a bike, enjoying the still evening. This is a quaint and quiet book worth sharing.<i>&#x2013;Lee Bock, Glenbrook Elementary School, Pulaski, WI</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Lucy&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;What? Huh?&#x201d; I was so excited for the bell to ring that I didn&#x2019;t hear my teacher calling my name. &#x201c;Oh.&#x201d; I raised my head, glanced at the long, sprawling math problem written across the whiteboard, and said, &#x201c;Four.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Mrs. Clark stared at me for a moment, then looked over her shoulder at the numbers she&#x2019;d written. &#x201c;Correct&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; She grabbed an eraser. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s all for today, class. No homework, so use your time to review today&#x2019;s lesson.&#x201d; The bell rang. &#x201c;Have a good after&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> I missed the &#x201c;&#x2014;noon&#x201d; because by the time she finished, I was already down the hall.<br> &nbsp;<br> I&#x2019;d been waiting for this moment since the day I saw the posting on the Halverston Middle School website, and now here it was. I was <i>finally</i> in sixth grade. I was <i>finally</i> going to my very first coding club meeting!<br> &nbsp;<br> I waved hello to my best friend, Anjali, as I passed her in the hall. She was rushing to film club in the opposite direction. &#x201c;Text me,&#x201d; she called out, though she didn&#x2019;t have to say it. I would have texted, anyway.<br> &nbsp;<br> I tightened my backpack straps and took off running. I&#x2019;d already picked out my seat in the computer lab. I wanted to be front and center. I was going to get started right away on an app that would help my uncle and change the world&#x2014;<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>Oof!</i><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Watch where you&#x2019;re going,&#x201d; Sophia Torres scoffed, blocking the way into the computer lab. Tall and fit, she filled the doorway when she spread her arms across it. There wasn&#x2019;t room for me to squeeze past.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Sorry,&#x201d; I said, looking down at her brand-new tennis shoes. I didn&#x2019;t want to start a fight. I just wanted her to move.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Geek,&#x201d; Sophia muttered under her breath.<br> &nbsp;<br> It stung a bit, but I didn&#x2019;t care. It wasn&#x2019;t the first time someone had called me that, and I wasn&#x2019;t going to let anyone ruin coding club for me. There were a few kids at school who intimidated me, but Sophia wasn&#x2019;t one of them. I puffed out my chest. &#x201c;Shouldn&#x2019;t you be doing sportsy stuff or something?&#x201d; I was pretty sure Sophia was managing the boys&#x2019; football team this fall. But we&#x2019;d barely spoken in months, so I wasn&#x2019;t positive.<br> &nbsp;<br> She rolled her eyes at me. They were as dark as her hair. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m taking Mondays off for this.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> I heard footsteps behind me. If I didn&#x2019;t move past Sophia immediately, other kids wouldn&#x2019;t be able to get into the room, either.<br> &nbsp;<br> I dodged left to pass her, but she blocked my path and laughed.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Come on, Soph,&#x201d; I said softly, calling her the nickname she&#x2019;d had since preschool. &#x201c;You know how important this is to me.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s important to me, too,&#x201d; she answered. And with that, Sophia turned and hustled into the room, throwing herself into the seat I wanted. She planted her hands in front of the computer that I&#x2019;d had mental dibs on.<br> &nbsp;<br> Sighing heavily, I took the seat at the end of the row and tried to ignore Sophia as the classroom filled with students. Even though we were ex-friends, there was no reason we couldn&#x2019;t be in coding club together. At least that&#x2019;s what I told myself.<br> &nbsp;<br> A bunch of other kids came into the room before&nbsp; Mrs. Clark arrived. She tipped her head at me. &#x201c;Well done, Lucy. You made it here in record time.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> I smiled. Mrs. Clark was my favorite teacher, and I was glad she was in charge of the club. She was born in Lebanon, went to England for college, and then came to the United States. She had such interesting stories about traveling the world and the things she did before she decided to become a teacher. Her stories almost made me want to be a teacher like her&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but only almost. I was going to be a computer programmer, just like my mom. Anjali always joked that my first word wasn&#x2019;t &#x201c;Dada,&#x201d; but rather &#x201c;data.&#x201d; She was probably right.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Alicia Lee&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Bradley Steinberg&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Maddie Lewis&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Mark Lewis&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;,&#x201d; Mrs. Clark read off the club list. When she hit the name Maya Chung, I whipped my head around. I hadn&#x2019;t seen Maya come in, and wondered what she was doing here. Maya was a seventh-grader and, unlike Sophia, she <i>was </i>one of those kids who scared me. Not because she was mean, but because she was really, really cool. She was the president of the student council and wrote a fashion column for the school newspaper. I&#x2019;d never talked to her, or even made eye contact before, because honestly, what would I say?<br> &nbsp;<br> I glanced down at my <i>Doctor Who</i> T-shirt. Maya would never wear a T-shirt and jeans, at least not without accessorizing with a scarf in her short black hair, or something bold, like a big necklace or earrings. That&#x2019;s what her last column said. I always read it.<br> &nbsp;<br> Looking at me, no one would guess I was interested in fashion. It&#x2019;s not like I spent a lot of time getting ready in the morning, but I liked reading what Maya wrote and doing some of the things she suggested, like painting my nails light pink. I loved the way they shimmered.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m here,&#x201d; Maya announced with a groan, as if this was the last place on earth she wanted to be. I figured if she wanted to learn coding, she could have started last year&#x2014;it was offered to sixth-graders and up. I wondered why she was starting now.<br> &nbsp;<br> Feeling self-conscious, I smoothed down a wrinkle in my T-shirt. Mrs. Clark was still reading names. &#x201c;Grace Rahman&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Sammy Cooper&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Ellie Foster&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Leila Devi&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> When were we going to start coding? We were ten minutes into the club time, and Mrs. Clark was still on roll call.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> When she seemed like she was almost finished, something <i>finally </i>happened.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>Beep! Beep! Beep!</i><br> &nbsp;<br> But this was not the something I was hoping for. I looked around for a minute before realizing that the noise was coming from my backpack. And it wasn&#x2019;t a soft, buzzy type of beep that could blend into classroom noises, or an echoing kind of beep that I could pretend was coming from the hall. It was a loud, annoying blast that made everyone in the club look in my direction.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Lucy,&#x201d; Mrs. Clark said with a stern expression. &#x201c;You know the rules about phones at school. The same applies to after-school programs.&#x201d; She pointed at my bag. &#x201c;Turn it off and turn it over. I&#x2019;ll keep it for the rest of the club.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> My heart was racing, and my face felt like it was on fire. I reached into my bag to find the phone, sure I was <br> having a heart attack. My phone had been on silent all day, like the school rules said, so I had no idea what was going on.<br> &nbsp;<br> After what seemed like an eternity, I found my phone, flipped it around, and desperately tried to silence it. But the screen stayed dark, and the beeps got louder.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Put it on vibrate,&#x201d; Maya said, with an exasperated look. It was horrifying that this was the first thing she&#x2019;d ever said to me.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I tried, but it&#x2019;s not working,&#x201d; I answered, feeling my face redden even more.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Try turning it off,&#x201d; Bradley said. He chuckled, his red freckles seeming to twinkle. He clearly thought this was hysterical.<br> &nbsp;<br> I glared at him. &#x201c;The screen won&#x2019;t even turn on.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Try slamming it on your desk,&#x201d; Bradley suggested, snickering to his friends.<br> &nbsp;<br> I ignored him.<br> &nbsp;<br> The beeping continued to echo through the classroom as kids shared their ideas. It felt like everyone was shouting at me, which only made my heart beat faster.<br> &nbsp;<br> Mrs. Clark came over to my desk. With her usual calm, she tucked her long dark hair behind her ears, pushed up her glasses, and held out her hand. I handed her my phone.<br> &nbsp;<br> For some reason, it finally opened to my main screen. She started swiping around, and I could tell she was looking through my apps.<br> &nbsp;<br> Suddenly, the beeps stopped. I took a deep breath, and my heartbeat settled.<br> &nbsp;<br> Mrs. Clark gave me a meaningful glance. &#x201c;Looks like someone who knows a thing or two about coding made a fake game and downloaded it onto your phone. It&#x2019;s programmed to beep and freeze your phone.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> How was that possible? I hadn&#x2019;t even noticed!<br> &nbsp;<br> I began to say I had no idea who would do that. It would have to be someone who had access to my phone. And someone who liked to play tricks on me.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Oh.&#x201d; I knew exactly who had messed with my phone, and from the look on Mrs. Clark&#x2019;s face, she did, too. Two afternoons a week, he was her student.<br> &nbsp;<br> Mrs. Clark gave me a sympathetic smile. &#x201c;Say hi to Alex for me when you see him.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I will,&#x201d; I said, but we both knew that when I got home I was going to have a lot more than &#x201c;hi&#x201d; to say to my brother!<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>Chapter Two</b><br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&#x201c;Is Erin Roberts here?&#x201d; Mrs. Clark asked, scanning the room as if someone might have slipped by her during the phone fiasco. I knew all the other kids, either from my classes or from around school. Mostly we were sixth-graders. Maya and Grace were the only seventh-graders.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Hmm. Doesn&#x2019;t look like it,&#x201d; she said, setting the roll-call sheet aside. &#x201c;Okay, then. Let&#x2019;s get started.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>Finally!</i><br> &nbsp;<br> The computer lab rules said students couldn&#x2019;t turn on the computers until the teacher gave permission. I raised my pointer finger and hovered it over the power button. I was waiting for Mrs. Clark to tell us to &#x201c;boot up.&#x201d; I could tell some other kids were doing the same thing.<br> &nbsp;<br> Instead, what we heard was: &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve set out some tables in the back. Gather around.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Mrs. Clark hefted three big brown paper bags into her arms. They&#x2019;d been tucked in a corner where I hadn&#x2019;t noticed them. &#x201c;This way.&#x201d; She walked toward the back of the room.<br> &nbsp;<br> Wait. What? My finger twitched. I must have misunderstood.<br> &nbsp;<br> I swiveled my chair toward Mrs. Clark and raised my hand.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Come along, Lucy,&#x201d; she said as most kids got up and went to the tables she&#x2019;d arranged at the back of the room.<br> &nbsp;<br> I stayed at the computer station and raised my hand higher, this time waving it.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Lucy,&#x201d; Mrs. Clark said. &#x201c;You can&#x2019;t have a question already&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;But&#x2014;&#x201d; I did. I had a thousand questions, the first one being, &#x201c;Am I in the right place?&#x201d; Maybe coding club met somewhere else, because I&#x2019;d expected to be sitting at computers, not at empty tables in the back of the room. How was I going to be the first black girl to win a Turing Award&#x2014;it&#x2019;s like a Nobel Prize for coding&#x2014;for my coding skills if we didn&#x2019;t actually use the computers?<br> &nbsp;<br> I opened my mouth to say all that, but Mrs. Clark cut me off. &#x201c;Hang on to your question, okay?&#x201d; She looked at me over her glasses. &#x201c;There will be time at the end of our club time to answer everything.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;But&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. We&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. App&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; My pointer finger felt heavy, as if it had a brick attached. I pulled it from the power button and walked slowly to the back of the room. Some of the other kids who&#x2019;d stayed at their computers shuffled along with me&#x2014;it wasn&#x2019;t like we had a choice.<br> &nbsp;<br> Mrs. Clark broke us into groups, setting a brown bag in front of each cluster. &#x201c;Sophia, Maya, and Lucy&#x2014;you&#x2019;ll be partners. You can take the middle table.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Ugh. Now I was being grouped with people who didn&#x2019;t even care about coding (well, Sophia said it was important to her, but I didn&#x2019;t believe her). I thought maybe this was a cruel joke. Or a dream. In a few minutes, I was going to wake up and discover that I&#x2019;d fallen asleep in math and that coding club hadn&#x2019;t started yet.<br> &nbsp;<br> Unfortunately, I was wide awake.<br> &nbsp;<br> First no computer, then no coding, and now my group was made up of one girl who was my mortal enemy and one who intimidated me&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. what more could happen?<br> &nbsp;<br> The computer lab door opened.<br> &nbsp;<br> The principal walked in, followed by a girl I didn&#x2019;t recognize.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You must be Erin,&#x201d; Mrs. Clark said warmly. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re joining the seventh grade today, right?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> The girl nodded, her blond hair falling over her glasses. When I looked a little closer, it seemed as though she might have been crying. She didn&#x2019;t say anything.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Welcome to coding club.&#x201d; Mrs. Clark led her over to my table. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re just getting started. You can join this group.&#x201d; We had three people while the others all had four. Now we were even.<br> &nbsp;<br> Just because I was mad that we weren&#x2019;t coding yet didn&#x2019;t mean I couldn&#x2019;t be polite. I imagined it would be hard to start at a new school after classes had already begun. Plus, Erin looked like she needed someone friendly, and I didn&#x2019;t trust the others at my table to be that person.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Hi,&#x201d; I said.<br> &nbsp;<br> Erin smiled faintly at me and then looked away toward the door. I think if Principal Stephens hadn&#x2019;t closed it when he left, she might have made a run for the hallway.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;All right.&#x201d; Mrs. Clark rubbed her hands together just like she did in math class when she was excited about introducing something new. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t touch the bags. That&#x2019;s for later. We&#x2019;re going to start today&#x2019;s session with a writing assignment.&#x201d; She handed out pencils and index cards. &#x201c;On your own, without help from your group, write down instructions for how to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> She pulled out a stopwatch. &#x201c;You have two minutes.&#x201d; She set the timer. &#x201c;Go.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Um, what? A peanut butter and jelly sandwich? What did this have to do with coding? I raised my hand.<br> &nbsp;<br> Mrs. Clark gave me a look that unmistakably meant, &#x201c;Later, Lucy.&#x201d; So I dropped it, figuring the faster we did her activity, the faster we&#x2019;d get back to the computers.<br> &nbsp;<br> I grabbed the card and scribbled:&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>Take two pieces of bread. Open the peanut butter. Spread it on one side of the bread. Open the jelly and spread it on the other side. Put the halves together. Ta-da, peanut butter and jelly sandwich.</i><br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> I was done in about three seconds. I sat back from the table and watched the others in my group. Maya was drawing a picture to accompany her instructions. She was a really good artist. Sometimes she did drawings to go with her articles in the paper. I wanted to say something to her, but what? She probably didn&#x2019;t even notice I was in her group.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>Charlie Brown and Friends: A PEANUTS Collection (Volume 2) (Peanuts Kids)</h2><p>What began in the funny pages in 1950 has developed into an enduring classic. Whether you're a fussbudget like Lucy, philosopher like Linus, Flying Ace like Snoopy, or a lovable loser like Charlie Brown, there is something to touch your heart or make you laugh in <i>Peanuts.</i><br><br> Charles Schulz's <i>Peanuts</i> is one of the most timeless and beloved comic strips ever. Now AMP! helps carry on that legacy with new collections of <i>Peanuts</i> classics focused around topics sure to resonate with middle-grade readers. Second in the series is <i>Charlie Brown and Friends.</i> Whether it's the curious relationship between a bird, Woodstock, and a dog, Snoopy, or the never-ending crush that Peppermint Patty has on Charlie Brown, the gang's interactions are what make <i>Peanuts</i> resonate with kids.<br><br> First published in 1950, the classic <i>Peanuts</i> strip now appears in more than 2,200 newspapers in 75 countries in 25 languages. Phrases such as "security blanket" and "good grief", which originated in the <i>Peanuts </i>world, are now part of the global vernacular, and images of Charles Schulz's classic characters - Charlie Brown kicking the football, Lucy leaning over Schroeder's piano - are now universally recognized.<br><br> Together these books will introduce a new generation of kids to the lovable cast in time for the new animated <i>Peanuts</i> movie, which hits theaters in 2015!</p><p>Charles Schulz is a legend.

This edition also includes a four-song sampler CD from jazz-great Vince Guaraldi's brilliant soundtrack.<p> With illustrator Paige Braddock aping Charles Schulz's style, <i>A Charlie Brown Christmas</i> retells the Emmy Award-winning program blow-by-blow (with a few omissions), from the ice-skating opening scene to preparations for the school pageant to Charlie Brown's ill-fated Christmas tree rescue. Braddock <i>almost</i> perfectly mimics the show's cast and backdrops, but just as no one could be fooled by even expert impersonation of a loved one, <i>Peanuts</i> fans might find the niggling differences distracting (whether it's Schroeder's too-wavy hair or Pig Pen's just-too-small head). </p><p> A "novelization" like this probably can't ever hope to completely recapture the charm of the original, even if it had used Schulz's original art.

The breakdown and explanation of the math skills is excellent.&nbsp; As a teacher who has been teaching Common Core for a few years, I wish I had had something like this to help guide me from the beginning. I will definitely recommend it for my school. This book is a winner for classroom teachers." </em> Author: Donna Adkins, First Grade Teacher<br><br><em>"I love the user-friendly organization of this book.&nbsp; Teachers in K-2 can easily check the prior grade level standards to see how each standard builds off of another. Teachers who have multi-age primary classrooms will appreciate the easy-to-follow examples.&nbsp; All teachers will value the clear "I do, you do" format presented in the book as well as the common misconceptions sections which will help teachers plan accordingly." </em> Author: Renee J. Nealon, Second Grade Teacher<br><br><p><em>"This book is worth its weight in gold, for states following the Common Core and for states who don&#x2019;t.

Grandpa Latke takes it upon himself to tell the story of "CHHA-nukah!" to Lucy Latke, but his narrative quickly goes off the rails: the heroes are yarmulke-wearing "mega-bees," not Maccabees; their enemy is "alien potatoes" instead of Antiochus; a dreidel is turned into a Trojan Horse; and the tongue twister "tattered tater tyrants" makes a totally gratuitous appearance. Thank goodness the family dog, Applesauce (also a latke), is on hand to set the story straight.

It is about outrunning the devil and achieving the impossible faith, diligence, and the desire to give back. It is the American dream come true and a stark reminder that saving one can help to save thousands more.</p><p>Lopez Lomong chronicles his inspiring ascent from a barefoot lost boy of the Sudanese Civil War to a Nike sponsored athlete on the US Olympic Team. Though most of us fall somewhere between the catastrophic lows and dizzying highs of Lomong's incredible life, every reader will find in his story the human spark to pursue dreams that might seem unthinkable, even from circumstances that might appear hopeless.</p><p>"Lopez Lomong's story is one of true inspiration. His life is a story of courage, hard work, never giving up, and having hope where there is hopelessness all around. Lopez is a true role model." <strong>?MICHAEL JOHNSON, Olympic Gold Medalist</strong></p><p>"This true story of a Sudanese child refugee who became an Olympic star is powerful proof that God gives hope to the hopeless and shines a light in the darkest places. Don't be surprised if after reading this incredible tale, you find yourself mysteriously drawn to run alongside him." <strong>?RICHARD STEARNS, president, World Vision US and author of <em>THe Hole in Our Gospel</em></strong></p></p><p><p>Lopez Lomong was born in Kimotong, a small village in southern Sudan, in 1985. Taken by rebel soldiers from the Sudan People&#x2019;s Liberation Army at age 6, Lomong embarked on the long journey from refugee camps to the world&#x2019;s largest athletic stage&#x2014;the Olympics. Founder of the Lopez Lomong Foundation, Lomong spends each day working to improve the lives of children in his homeland.</p><br><br><p>&nbsp;Mark Tabb has authored or coauthored more than thirty books, including the number one <em>New York Times</em> bestseller, <em>Mistaken Identity</em>.&nbsp;</p>"The story of a former Lost Boy of Sudan is really a journey, one that takes Lopez Lomong from his life as a 6-year-old boy in a refugee camp to a whole new world as a teen in the United States. How he gets to America is an amazing story, but even more amazing are the new wonders and possibilities of his new life here. Brandon Hirsch&#x2019;s narration focuses on all the emotions of the loquacious Lopez&#x2014;especially fear, incredulity, and pride. As Lopez&#x2014;an exceptional athlete and a devout Catholic&#x2014;writes of his struggles and accomplishments, Hirsch&#x2019;s narration is always right there with him. As a team, they&#x2019;re like two runners on an even pace around a track, never breaking stride and waiting for that final kick."&nbsp;<br>M.B. � AudioFile Portland, Maine<br></p><h2>How Do I Love You?

They hide their tortillas, tamales, beans, and flour and put on torn clothes to look poor. But the Capit�n is not fooled. He asks for a cactus thorn to make some cactus soup, and before long he has tricked the townspeople into giving him salt and chilies, vegetables, and a chicken as well! Whimsical watercolors by Phil Huling add to the humor in this southwestern twist on the classic Stone Soup tale.</p><p>Author Eric A. Kimmel is well-known for the tales he has retold from around the world. Some of his best-known titles are <em>Hershel and the Hanukkah Goblins</em> (a Caldecott Honor Book), <em>Gershon&#x2019;s Monster, Anansi and the Talking Melon, </em>and <em>The Runaway Tortilla</em>. A former professor of children&#x2019;s literature, he lives in Portland, Oregon. <p>Phil Huling has also illustrated <em>Puss in Cowboy Boots</em>, by his wife, Jan. The Hulings live in Hoboken, New Jersey.</p>*Starred Review* Gr. 1-3. Kimmel once recast the gingerbread boy as a traditional Mexican foodstuff in <i>The Runaway Tortilla </i>(2000); illustrator Huling's previous picture book, <i>Puss in Cowboy Boots </i>(2002),<i> </i>plunked Charles Perrault's wily cat in the Southwest. How appropriate, then, that the two should team up to create a chile<i>-</i>infused recipe for stone soup. Their version is set in the Mexico of the Zapatistas, and it's a regiment of revolutionaries who suggest cactus-spine soup to villagers made stingy by a mayor who warns that soldiers "eat like wolves!" But cactus soup, of course, isn't as tasty without salt, pepper, chiles<i>, </i>onions, beans, and a chicken or two . . . "But why ask for what you don't have?" Soon missing ingredients materialize by the basketful, resulting in a splendid feast for the hungry soldiers and a rousing fiesta<i> </i>for all. Kimmel's relaxed storytelling, accompanied by a glossary for those whose Spanish vocabulary may not encompass <i>camote </i>(sweet potato) and <i>alcalde </i>(mayor), is perfectly matched by the sun-baked watercolors by Huling, whose lanky villagers dwarfed by looming sombreros, swaybacked horses, and bowlegged vaqueros evoke both the exaggerated perspectives of Mexican muralists and the tongue-in-cheek universe of Speedy Gonzales. A savory stew to serve alongside traditional versions of the classic tale. <i>Jennifer Mattson</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Witty and direct . . . both Granny and child are swallowed, then rescued intact by the hunter who kills the wolf. . . . A perfect union of words, story, and illustration.&#34;--Kirkus Reviews.</p><p>James Marshall was&nbsp;one of the most prolific and successful author/illustrators of children's books. He was best known for his series on the mischievous exploits of Fox, a debonair, lazy showoff; the uproarious adventures of the two Cut-Ups, Spud and Joe; George and Martha; and the misadventures of the Stupidfamily.&nbsp;He divided his time between an apartment in the Chelsea district of New York and his home in Mansfield Hollow Connecticut.PreSchool-Grade 3 This irresistible retelling of the familiar tale will rank high in popular appeal while still maintaining the integrity of the Grimm Brothers' version, with both Grandma and Red Riding Hood eaten and later rescued by a hunter. Through simple words and a restrained use of line in the art, Marshall masterfully imbues his characters with humorous personality traits. The heroine is a considerate, bouncy sort of kid; Grandma, an avid reader, is feisty; and the wolf, a charming villain, is just a bit guilty about his behaviorafter his second meal he admits, ``I'm so wicked. . .so wicked.'' With just a flick of the whiskers even Grandma's heavy-set feline looks both outraged and scared. The cartoon styled ink and watercolor illustrations play harmoniously along with the spare story, and as the drama heightens viewers are treated to fresh perspectives and enticing peeks into Grandma's bedroom. Cheery colors predominate, with a judicious use of black effectively conveying tense moments. Throughout, comic touches are understated (a box of empty imported after-dinner mints lay discretely beside the snoring wolf). A marvelous offering that begs to be added to everyone's storytelling repertoire.

Just before class, "Jessie pokes her polka dots. / Kiki carries tarts. / Lenny hugs a bagful of a hundred candy hearts."

Soon -- <i>poof!</i> -- each child comes away with something better than they could've imagined -- a book that helps them become whatever they want to be, and makes their dreams come true through pages and words, and the adventures that follow. But each child can't help but wonder, <i>What's really making the magic happen?</i><br><br><b>"Malcolm Mitchell is changing the world through the power of reading." -- Dav Pilkey, bestselling creator of the Dog Man and Captain Underpants series<br><br>"<i>The Magician's Hat</i> will cast its spell on you!" -- Jeff Kinney, bestselling author of the Diary of a Wimpy Kid series</b></p><p>Malcolm Mitchell is the rookie who helped the New England Patriots win Super Bowl LI. He's also the founder of an initiative called Read with Malcolm, which introduces book ownership to students, and works to improve literacy in schools.

Joanne also is the illustrator of the Hilde Cracks the Case series by Hilde Lysiak. She lives in Amsterdam with her husband and two children.PreS-Gr 2&#x2014;New England Patriots wide receiver Mitchell has written a serviceable paean to reading as a means of making your (career) dreams come true. Suitably cheerful cartoon illustrations show a diverse group of children and families at a magic show at the library, with psychic reader's advisory as the grand finale. One by one, children from the audience reach into the magician's top hat for books, each of which is somehow about that child's dream career, thus proving that "books are magic." The lanky white magician even convinces a skeptical kid who claims to want to be a dog when he grows up: deep down the boy wants to be an astronaut, so the magic hat gives him a book about space. There are missed opportunities to promote the joy of reading for its own sake, as well as to encourage perseverance when reading does not feel like magic. Nevertheless, the amusing story encourages children to see the library as a fun place and to see books as a source of inspiration and support for their passions. VERDICT A good-natured addition, if a bit simplistic about the benefits of reading.&#x2014;Sarah Stone, San Francisco Public Library</p><h2>Independent Study: The Testing, Book 2 (The Testing, 2)</h2><p>In the series debut <i>The Testing</i>, sixteen-year-old Cia Vale was chosen by the United Commonwealth government as one of the best and brightest graduates of all the colonies . . . a promising leader in the effort to revitalize postwar civilization. In <i>Independent Study</i>, Cia is a freshman at the University in Tosu City with her hometown sweetheart, Tomas&#x2014;and though the government has tried to erase her memory of the brutal horrors of The Testing, Cia remembers. Her attempts to expose the ugly truth behind the government&#x2019;s murderous programs put her&#x2014;and her loved ones&#x2014;in a world of danger.

Blue, long-sleeved tunic. Gray pants. Silver bracelet with a single star. The star and the smudges of fatigue under my eyes mark me as an entry-level University student. My fellow classmates show similar signs of having studied late into the night for today. After six months of taking the same preliminary classes, all twenty of us will be tested and sorted into the fields of study that will serve as the focus for the rest of our lives.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My chest tightens. I used to enjoy taking tests. I liked proving that I had learned. That I had worked hard. That I was smart. But now I am not sure what is real or what the consequences of a wrong answer will be. While my classmates are concerned about the test affecting the years ahead, I worry I will not survive the day.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Normally, I pull my hair back into a thick dark knot in order to keep it out of my way. Today, I decide to leave it down. Perhaps the long waves will hide the evidence of months of restless nights. If not, maybe the cold compresses my mother taught me to apply to my eyes will help.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A wave of longing crashes over me at the thought of my mother. While contact between University students and their families is not expressly forbidden, neither is it encouraged. Most students I know have not heard a word from their loved ones back home. I have been fortunate. A Tosu official has been willing to pass along small bits of communication from my parents and four older brothers. They are well. My father and my oldest brother, Zeen, are creating a new fertilizer to help plants grow faster. My second oldest brother, Hamin, is engaged. He and his soon-to-be wife will be married next spring. His decision to marry has prompted our mother to look for wives for Zeen and my twin brothers, Hart and Win. So far, her efforts have been in vain.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aside from my family, one other person has managed to get news to me. My best friend, Daileen, assures me she&#x2019;s studying hard and is currently first in her class. Her teacher has hinted Daileen might be chosen for The Testing this year. She is keeping her fingers crossed that she will join me in Tosu City. I am hoping she will fail. I want her to stay in a place where the answers to questions make sense. Where I know she will be safe.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A knock at the door makes me jump. &#x201c;Hey, Cia. Are you ready? We don&#x2019;t want to be late.&#x201d; Stacia&#x2019;s right. Those who arrive late will not be allowed to take the exam. What that means for the future is unclear, but none of us wants to find out.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be ready in a minute,&#x201d; I yell as I kneel next to the foot of the bed and slide my hand between the bed frame and the mattress. My fingers search until they find the lump that makes me sigh with relief. My brother Zeen&#x2019;s Transit Communicator is still safe, as are the secrets it holds.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Months ago, I discovered the symbol I carved into the device to help lead me to the recorder and the confidences stored inside. When I finished listening to words I had no recollection of speaking, I cut open the mattress and hid the Communicator inside. Week after week, month after month, I tried to pretend that what the device revealed isn&#x2019;t real. After all, haven&#x2019;t I seen evidence every day that my fellow students are good people? That the professors and administrators working to prepare us for our futures want us to succeed? Some of them are standoffish. Others arrogant. None of the students or educators is perfect, but who is? No matter their flaws, I don&#x2019;t want to believe any are capable of the whispered, sometimes hard to make out words inside the recorder.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Cia.&#x201d; Stacia&#x2019;s voice pulls me from my thoughts. &#x201c;We have to get going.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Right. Sorry.&#x201d; I slip into my coat, hoist my University bag onto my shoulder, and turn my back on my questions about the past. Those will have to wait. For now, I need to concentrate on my future.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stacia frowns as I step into the hall. Her dark blond hair is pulled back into a sleek ponytail, making her angular features look sharper than usual. &#x201c;What took you so long? We&#x2019;re going to be the last ones to arrive.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Which will make everyone nervous,&#x201d; I quip. &#x201c;They&#x2019;ll wonder why we didn&#x2019;t feel the need to get there early and compare notes with everyone else.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stacia&#x2019;s eyes narrow as she nods. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re right. I love psyching out the competition.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hate it. My parents taught me to value fair play over all else.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stacia doesn&#x2019;t notice my discomfort as we trek past healthy trees, thriving grass, and numerous academic structures. Not that she would say anything if she did. Stacia isn&#x2019;t one for girl talk or idle chatter. At first her silences challenged me to bring her out of her shell, as I used to do for my best friend from Five Lakes. Now, with so many questions on my mind, I am grateful for the quiet company.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wave at a couple of older students as they walk by. As always, they ignore us. After today, the upperclassmen assigned to the same field of study will act as our guides. Until then, they pretend we don&#x2019;t exist. Most of my classmates have taken to ignoring them back, but I can&#x2019;t. My upbringing is too strong not to be polite.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Ha. I should have known he&#x2019;d be waiting for us.&#x201d; Stacia rolls her eyes and then laughs. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d bet my family&#x2019;s compensation money that he hovered around you during The Testing, too. Too bad I&#x2019;ll never know if I&#x2019;d win that bet.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My heart skips as I spot Tomas Endress standing near the front door of the four-story red and white brick Early Studies building. His dark hair blows in the late-winter breeze. A University bag is slung carelessly over his shoulder. His gray eyes and dimpled smile are focused squarely on me as he waves and comes bounding down the steps. Tomas and I have known each other all our lives, but in the last couple months, we&#x2019;ve grown closer than I dreamed possible back home. When Tomas is with me, I feel smarter. More confident. And terrified that everything I think I know and admire about him is a lie.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stacia rolls her eyes as Tomas kisses my cheek and entwines his fingers with mine. &#x201c;I was starting to get worried about you. The test starts in ten minutes.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Cia and I didn&#x2019;t feel the need to get here early and cram like everyone else. We&#x2019;re totally prepared. Right, Cia?&#x201d; Stacia tosses her blond ponytail and shoots me one of her rare smiles.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Right,&#x201d; I say with more conviction than I feel. Yes, I have studied hard for this test, but the whispered words on the Transit Communicator make me doubt I could ever fully prepare for what is to come.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not for the first time, I wish my father were here to talk to me. Almost three decades ago, he attended the University. Growing up, I asked hundreds of questions about his time here. Rarely did he answer them. Back then, I assumed his silence was to keep my brothers and me from feeling pressure to follow in his footsteps. Now I&#x2019;m forced to wonder if something more sinister lay behind his secrecy.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is only one way to find out.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three of us climb the steps. When we reach the front door, Tomas stops and asks for a moment alone with me. Stacia sighs, warns me not to be late, and stalks inside. When she&#x2019;s out of sight, Tomas brushes a hair off my forehead and peers into my eyes. &#x201c;Did you sleep at all last night?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Some.&#x201d; Although with sleep comes the nightmares that hover just out of reach when I wake. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t worry. Being your study partner means I can answer questions no matter how tired I am.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While other students used their free time to relax or explore the United Commonwealth capital, Tosu City, Tomas and I spent all our spare moments with our books under a tree or in the library when the cold weather drove us inside. Most of our classmates assumed Tomas and I pretended to study in order to be alone. They don&#x2019;t understand my fear of what might happen if I do not pass this exam.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tomas gives my hand a squeeze. &#x201c;Things will get easier once we&#x2019;ve been given our designated areas of study. You&#x2019;re a shoo-in for Mechanical Engineering.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s hope you&#x2019;re right.&#x201d; I smile. &#x201c;While I&#x2019;d love to work with you, the idea of being assigned Biological Engineering scares the hell out of me.&#x201d; My father and brothers are geniuses at coaxing plants to thrive in the war-scarred earth. Revitalizing the earth is an important job. One I admire. I might even be happy to consider it, if I didn&#x2019;t kill every plant I touched.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Come on.&#x201d; Tomas brushes a light kiss on my lips and tugs me toward the steps. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s show them how smart students from Five Lakes are.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hallway of the Early Studies building is dim. Only the sunshine that creeps in from the glass panes in the front door lights our way. Tosu City has strict laws governing electricity usage. While the production and storage of electricity are more robust than in Five Lakes, conservation is encouraged. During the daytime, the University only directs electricity to labs or classrooms that require extra light for the day&#x2019;s lesson. At night, however, the University has a much higher allotment of power than the rest of the city.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second-floor examination room is well illuminated in honor of today&#x2019;s test. The lights make it easy to see the tension etched in my classmates&#x2019; faces as they sit behind black desks, poring over their notes, hoping to cram one last fact that could make the difference between the futures they want and whatever else our professors might decide.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One final student arrives. I take a seat at an empty desk in the back. Tomas slides into the desk to the right of mine. I put my bag on the floor and glance around the room. Twenty of us. Thirteen boys. Seven girls. The future leaders of the United Commonwealth.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am about to wish Tomas luck when Professor Lee arrives. For the past several months, Professor Lee has served as our history instructor. While most of the University teachers wear sober expressions, Professor Lee has kind eyes and a warm smile, which is why he&#x2019;s my favorite. Today, instead of the faded brown jacket he favors, our instructor is wearing a ceremonial purple United Commonwealth jumpsuit. The room goes silent as Professor Lee walks up and down the rows of desks. On each desk he drops a booklet of paper and a yellow pencil. I run my hand over the image in the corner of the booklet&#x2019;s cover. A lightning bolt. My symbol. Given to me in The Testing.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Professor Lee asks us not to open the booklet until further instruction is given. The booklet is thick. Back at Five Lakes, paper is harder to come by, so we use it sparingly and make sure to recycle every page when we are done. Here in Tosu City, learning takes priority over rationing.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My fingers toy with the pencil, rolling it back and forth across the black desk surface. Out of the corner of my eye, I catch Tomas watching me with a concerned expression. Suddenly, I&#x2019;m in a different room. Eight students. A different male official dressed in ceremonial male purple. Eight black desks. Bright white walls instead of gray. Six boys. Only two girls in the room, one of whom is me. Tomas gives me the same worried look as I finger a pencil. The booklet in front of me is marked with the same lightning bolt, only this time, it is surrounded by an eight-pointed star. My symbol surrounded by the symbol of my group for The Testing.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The room in my memory disappears as Professor Lee&#x2019;s deep voice announces, &#x201c;Congratulations on completing the basic studies required for all University students. Today&#x2019;s test, combined with evaluations from your professors, will determine which field of study your skills are best suited for. Tomorrow, a list will be posted with your test results, as well as which field of study you have been directed into: Education, Biological Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Medicine, or Government. All five fields of study are necessary to continue the revitalization of our land, our technology, and our citizens. While each of you has a preferred choice, we ask you to trust us to slot you into the career path that best suits the needs of the country. Do not attempt to guess which questions on the examination affect direction into a specific field of study. Any students with questionable test results will be given a failing grade and Redirected from the University student roster.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Professor Lee scans the room to make sure the impact of his words is felt. I can hear my heart hammer in the silence.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, he continues. &#x201c;Answer each question to the best of your ability. Do not give answers beyond the scope of the question. We are interested in learning not only how much you know but how well you comprehend the question being asked. Answers that go beyond the confines of the question will negatively affect your test results.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I swallow hard and wonder what the negative effect might be. A lowered score or something more?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;You will have eight hours to complete this examination. If you need a break for food, water, or to relieve yourself, please raise your hand. A University official will escort you to the break room. If at any time you exit this room, you are not to leave the building or speak to anyone other than your escort. Either action will result in a failing grade and Redirection from the University. When you have completed the examination, raise the test booklet. I will collect the booklet and escort you to the door. What you do after that is up to you.&#x201d; He gives us a knowing smile before pushing a button on the wall behind him.</p></p><h2>Too Many Tribbles!

A gorgeous new edition of the universal fable that has inspired seekers of all ages to follow their heart&#x2019;s desire.</b><br><br><i>Ask yourself where it is you want to go. . . .</i><br><br>It is often said that life is a journey, and it&#x2019;s true. But sometimes it&#x2019;s hard to know which path to follow, when signs point in so many directions. In this beautifully illustrated book, Peter H. Reynolds once again encourages readers to observe, to wonder, and to consider diverging from the well-worn path&#x2014;to pursue their dreams. Originally published ten years ago, <i>The North Star</i> has had a profound effect on its many readers. This edition, featuring all-new art, celebrates the book&#x2019;s own decade-long voyage connecting people around the world.

The narrative opens, "A sweet breeze met the boy as he awoke to his journey. He traveled on all fours for quite some time...and he grew. And he paused." These lines are very soothing and accompanied by pictures that show a baby staring out from under a tree, crawling through some grass, and sitting cross-legged meditatively. Then the lengthy story meanders as the boy follows a rabbit down a path, wonders about a leaf and the stars, and meets a cat who advises him to start his journey so he won't "be left behind." The child replies, "Oh, but I <i>have</i> been on a journey...I've seen many wonderful things. Some I understand, and some I don't...like how that leaf floats on the water." The child continues his travels, meeting other animals who give advice and make pronouncements about the journey of life, a frog concluding that he is content to stay in his bog where he swam as a tadpole and grew into an adult. These philosophical musings, while simply stated, are unlikely to find a wide audience.&#x2014;<i>Kirsten Cutler, Sonoma County Library, CA</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Miss Malarkey tells her class that they will be doing the Everybody Reads in America program and promises that all of the students will find books they love before the end of the school year. She picks some for each of them, engaging even reluctant readers. One boy remains unable to find a book he likes until June 10, when Miss Malarkey chooses one that has aliens, race cars, funny jokes, chewing gum, hot sauce, and cannonballs. It becomes number 1001 read by the students and the story ends with everyone wishing Principal Wiggins (whose hair is now purple) a good night on the roof. This title will resonate with those who choose math, video games, and sports over books. O'Malley's illustrations, done in markers and colored pencils, enhance the text with expressive pictures of the students and their teacher as they explore (or choose not to explore) the joys of reading. The illustrations lend humor and credibility to the reluctance of some of the students.

Lucy&#x2019;s expectations of unicorn pizazz fall flat, but in this underdog tale, love conquers all." - Seira Wilson, Amazon Editor<br><br>When Lucy sees an ad in the newspaper for a unicorn, she sends in her twenty-five cents and waits four to six long weeks for her very own unicorn to arrive. She imagines the flowers that she'll braid into his beautiful pink mane, and she even picks the perfect name for him: Sparkle. But when Sparkle arrives, his ears are too long, his horn is too short, he smells funny--and oh, he has fleas. Lucy isn't pleased, but in the end she warms up to Sparkle and realizes that even though he wasn't exactly the unicorn she wanted, he might be just the one she needs.</p><p><b>Amy Young</b> was born in Boston, Massachusetts, and though she trained and practiced as a lawyer, she has always wanted to be an artist. Her first picture book, which she wrote and illustrated, was<i> Belinda the Ballerina</i>. Since then, she has written and illustrated many picture books. She lives in Spring Lake, Michigan, with her husband.PreS-Gr 1&#x2014;When a girl named Lucy sees an ad in the paper selling unicorns for 25 cents, she sends off for one right away. Lucy has high expectations for her new unicorn, whom she plans to name Sparkle as she rides on his majestic back and impresses all of her friends. However, when Sparkle arrives, he is spotted, short, and mischievous and has fleas. At first Lucy wants to return him to the man she bought him from, but she soon warms up to him when she realizes that, despite his flaws, Sparkle is actually very sweet. Children will laugh at Sparkle's naughty antics but also root for him to win Lucy over, feel heartbroken when she initially chooses to return Sparkle, and cheer when the two are reunited at the end. This is a humorous and charming story about managing unrealistic expectations, choosing a pet, and acting responsibly. Young skillfully draws the endearingly scruffy Sparkle so that even though he more closely resembles an odd-looking "goat" than a unicorn, he is still undeniably adorable. The last page, in which a smiling Lucy declares, "Welcome Home!" and embraces a visibly happy Sparkle, is the perfect endnote.

Welles kept it with him that day, and just about every day to come; it became a fixture and his signature.<br><br>A standout athlete growing up in Upper Nyack, NY, Welles was also a volunteer at the local fire department, along with his father.&nbsp;He cherished the necessity and the camaraderie, the meaning of the role. Fresh from college, he took a Wall Street job on the 104th&nbsp;floor of the South Tower of the World Trade Center, but the dream of becoming a firefighter with the FDNY remained.<br><br>When the Twin Towers fell, Welles&#x2019;s parents had no idea what happened to him. In the unbearable days that followed, they came to accept that he would never come home. But the mystery of his final hours persisted.&nbsp;Eight months after the attacks, however, Welles&#x2019;s mother read a news account from several survivors, badly hurt on the 78th floor of the South Tower, who said they and others had been led to safety by a stranger, carrying a woman on his back, down nearly twenty flights of stairs.&nbsp; After leading them down, the young man turned around.&nbsp; &#x201c;I&#x2019;m going back up,&#x201d; was all he said. <br><br>The survivors didn&#x2019;t know his name, but despite the smoke and panic, one of them remembered a single detail clearly: the man was wearing a red bandanna. &nbsp;<br><br>Tom Rinaldi&#x2019;s&nbsp;<i>The Red Bandanna</i>&nbsp;is about a fearless choice, about a crucible of terror and the indomitable spirit to answer it. Examining one decision in the gravest situation, it celebrates the difference one life can make.</p><p>Tom Rinaldi&nbsp;has been a national correspondent at ESPN since 2002.

Press your hand down upon it and flatten it, into the surface of your desk, or the edge of the bed, or along the line of your leg. Twenty-two inches along any side, four ounces in your hand, barely enough weight to notice.

Look at it.</i><br><br><i>What do you see there, in the red, white, and black? Is there something in the ancient pattern and the Persian fig shape, the paisley teardrop and the flat pointed stars?

Dying.</i><br><br><i>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s all in there,&#x201d; the father says. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s all in that bandanna.&#x201d;</i><br><br>They searched for the right name. He was their first, and they felt the weight of the decision. A name is the label for a life, the first thing you&#x2019;re given upon entering the world, and the heading for all you leave behind when you&#x2019;re gone.<br><br>Should they look to their lineage, to honor their bloodlines, or pick a name that would be free of the past, to accrue its own meaning over time?<br><br>In the end, history won, as it usually does. On May 17<i>, </i>1977, in New York City,<i> </i>the first child of Alison and Jeff Crowther was born: Welles Remy Crowther.<br><br>The boy was named after a man his parents never met.<br><br>Henry Spalding Welles was Alison&#x2019;s great-uncle in several senses of the word, a figure shrouded in stories and tales, legends she&#x2019;d heard about since childhood. A favorite of Alison&#x2019;s father, Frank, Uncle Henry led an outsized life, certainly by the family&#x2019;s&nbsp;telling. Despite living in Manhattan, he was an accomplished professional sportsman, working as a hired shot and public marksman, for Remington, America&#x2019;s oldest gun maker. As legend had it, Uncle Henry once hit two hundred clays in succession in �competition, a display to prove the accuracy and effectiveness of �Remington&#x2019;s newest shotgun. He also worked for True Temper, a manufacturer of fishing rods and reels, and was accomplished as a fly fisherman. Uncle Henry invented and held a patent for a diving plug, a wooden lure carved and weighted to penetrate the surface&nbsp;of the water, to help catch fish in any type of water, any time of day.<br><br>For Alison, it wasn&#x2019;t so much the tales as the way they were told, the spark that came into her father&#x2019;s voice when he spoke about Henry Spalding Welles, the look that crossed his face.<br><br>&#x201c;I thought, what could be a better name?&#x201d; Alison recalled. &#x201c;There was just this magic about Uncle Henry.&#x201d; The stories about the man, the ones her family loved to tell with laughter and pride and wonder&#x2014;about beating Annie Oakley in a shooting competition, about sailing wooden boats across the ponds of Central Park, about President Eisenhower using his trout fishing flies&#x2014;all shared the theme of taking a bold and unpredicted line through life. It was a name they hoped their son would make his own.<br><br>Alison Remy&#x2019;s own line was a gentle loop, from the suburbs of Westchester to a campus in New England, then back south to Manhattan. She grew up in the house where her father did, the house her grandfather built on Shawnee Road in the wealthy village of&nbsp;Scarsdale, north of Manhattan. Her grandfather and father, Frank Remy Sr. and Frank Remy Jr., shared more than the family home; both were graduates of New York University, both were dentists, and both were athletes.<br><br>When Alison graduated from Scarsdale High School in 1966, she didn&#x2019;t follow the family path to NYU. Instead, she enrolled in Wheaton College in Norton, Massachusetts. Founded as a female seminary in 1834, Wheaton was one of the oldest colleges for women in America. There were antiwar protests during her time there, but the small school was far from an epicenter of the countercultural unrest exploding across American campuses in the late 1960s, and the academic environment was serious and challenging. The student body, twelve hundred women by the time Alison graduated, was expected to be diligent, studious, and involved. That worked for Alison, who was a dedicated student with a passion for environmental studies. She headed the first Earth Day celebration on campus.<br><br>The summer before her junior year, she went on a blind date set up by another couple. Alison got the call only after the woman originally scheduled for the date had to cancel and the matchmakers didn&#x2019;t want to stand the suitor up or hurt his feelings. When Jeff Crowther walked into the room, Alison had a completely novel reaction:<br><br>&#x201c;It was love at first sight,&#x201d; she recalled. &#x201c;It really was.&#x201d;<br><br>For Jeff Crowther, the fact that his first date had canceled, upsetting the night&#x2019;s original plans, fit his own line well enough. If there was a prescribed path, odds were he wasn&#x2019;t following it.<br><br>Jeff had grown up in White Plains, a larger, more diverse city just north of Scarsdale. His family had its roots in Maryland, but his father&#x2019;s work brought them to New York. Bosley Crowther, a <i>New York Times</i> reporter, writer, and critic, spent forty years with the paper. As a student at Princeton, he entered a current events contest cosponsored by the <i>Times</i> and a new weekly magazine called <i>Time. </i>His essay, on why the Calvin Coolidge administration should withdraw its forces in Nicaragua, won first place. The prize? A five-hundred-dollar check and a job offer with the <i>New York Times.</i><br><br>Starting as a cub reporter in 1928, Crowther&nbsp;worked his way up&nbsp;to general reporter, rewrite man, feature writer, and then, in 1940, the paper&#x2019;s chief movie critic. He held the position for twenty-seven years, becoming an institution. Bosley&#x2019;s reviews held extraordinary weight, often setting up films for success or failure.<br><br>Though his father and grandfather had attended Princeton, Jeff went in a different direction. At his mother&#x2019;s suggestion, he headed to Clark University in Worcester, Massachusetts, a respected academic institution, though not overly challenging for him, at least not at first. He sailed through freshman year without developing any impulse to study, or even to attend classes regularly. By the end of his sophomore year, after spending his time betting on horses at a local track, playing pool in the basement of his dormitory, and impressing buddies as the social director for his fraternity, he was summoned by the dean and told he needed a break, to refocus. &#x201c;I got thrown out&#x201d; is how he characterized it.<br><br>Without telling his parents he had been suspended, Jeff took a step few saw coming: in the summer of 1965, he joined the navy, and was stationed in San Diego for his two years of service. By the time he returned east, he held a different, wiser view toward his college opportunity. He met Alison Remy just as he was getting ready to resume life as an undergrad, this time at NYU.<br><br>That first date was a smashing success. Alison returned home that night, found her father still up working in his office, and declared: &#x201c;Dad, I think I&#x2019;ve met the man I want to marry.&#x201d;<br><br>Her father was considerably less moved. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t be silly&#x201d; was his reply.<br><br>A few miles north, Jeff told his mother the very same thing that night.<br><br>Alison had an intuition, a burgeoning feeling, about the night, about all connected to it&#x2014;the man she&#x2019;d met, the feelings he sparked, the summer fading and the autumn approaching. Even about the date itself.<br><br>&#x201c;I will never forget thinking,&#x201d; she recalled more than four decades later, &#x201c;this day, it&#x2019;s going to have a special meaning for us. I had a powerful sense about it, not only that we just met on this date, but there was something else that was going to make this an important day for our family&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; Her voice trailed off.<br><br>The year was 1968.<br><br>The date was September 11.<br><br>She graduated in 1970 with a degree in biology and landed a job in medical research at one of the most prestigious addresses for research in the country, Rockefeller University. Alison was going back to New York.<br><br>At Rockefeller, she was assigned to help with lab work on a project led by Dr. Vincent Dole and his wife, Dr. Marie Nyswander,&nbsp;who were pioneering the use of a new treatment for heroin addiction. The couple had developed a synthetic medication, �methadone, to reduce the intensely painful symptoms of withdrawal that so many addicts experienced in trying to get clean. At the time, addiction&nbsp;was widely seen as something other than a medical problem, viewed through a moral lens, as a defect of character. The doctors rejected&nbsp;that notion and pioneered the use of methadone to help �addicts wean&nbsp;themselves from heroin. For his work, Dole would receive the Lasker Award, one of the greatest prizes in American medicine.<br><br>Alison was working on lab experiments with mice and rats, injecting the rodents with radioactive methadone to track the effects over a span of months. She was also dating. And on a ferry ride to Martha&#x2019;s Vineyard in the fall of 1970, Jeff proposed. The wedding was the first day of May 1971.<br><br>They moved to an apartment in Hastings-on-Hudson, a quaint village in Westchester, and began a life together, Jeff as a banker and Alison continuing as a research assistant. They wanted to start a family, but it took awhile to happen. Alison stopped working at Rockefeller in 1976, to avoid any further exposure to the radioactivity in her lab. Later that year, she and Jeff told the family the news. Alison was expecting.<br><br><i>The slide show still plays in the father&#x2019;s head, a perpetual reel. No conscious decision clicks its carousel to life or chooses the sequence; there&#x2019;s no beam to ignite the dust floating between lens and screen. There is no screen at all, no place outside his head to play the slides. The pictures explode across the sides of his mind, sometimes with enough force to tighten his chest and steal his breath.</i><br><br><i>Every frame contains his son. A boy blossoming, awkward and �beautiful, unfolding into his own life. Rarely are the portraits from milestones, from the passages through the razor wire of adolescence, the first Communions and junior proms, the formal poses and family events, the birthday parties and holiday dinners. Those have moved to the background somehow.</i><br><br><i>The father can&#x2019;t stop the show, even if he wants to. He knows he won&#x2019;t ever keep them away. The visions come, uninvited and beyond any governing, a tax on his sorrow. The pictures thrill and sear him, comfort and afflict him.</i><br><br><i>The picture just now is the first frame in a short movie. The son is just a toddler, not even three years old. He is down on the floor in the living room, playing with the family dog. The two wrestle over a toy, which is the dog&#x2019;s property, the dog biting and the boy pulling, each holding on with all his might. The dog is bigger, stronger. From room to room, the father watches as the dog drags his son around, both wild with delight, neither willing to let go. They play until each is exhausted.</i><br><br><i>At times when the boy&#x2019;s grip weakens, his balance falters, and he slides into furniture and crashes into walls. But in the picture in the father&#x2019;s head, the boy won&#x2019;t stop, or cry, or look for help. In his tiny movie, flashing frame by frame, his son goes right back at the dog, until the dog is too tired to keep fighting. The game always ends the same way, with the toy in the boy&#x2019;s hands.</i><br><br>He knew what he wanted to do, and to be.<br><br>From the time Welles was in preschool, when he was asked about his future, he had an immediate and confident answer: he would be a fireman. Not like the ones in children&#x2019;s books, but like the people who shared his name and his house. From the time he was a tyke, both his grandfathers would take him to the firehouses in their respective cities&#x2014;Alison&#x2019;s father, Frank, to the red-tiled, brick-faced, double-doored Fire Station No. 2 in Hartsdale; Jeff&#x2019;s father, Bosley (whom the grandchildren called &#x201c;Geeps&#x201d;), to the firehouse in White Plains, just a few blocks from his&nbsp;house. They made the visits not because they were volunteers themselves; they saw the shine in their grandson&#x2019;s eyes, and fed his wonder.<br><br>Welles also liked to spend time with Geeps in his home office, &#x201c;playing business,&#x201d; as the boy called it, hiking himself up behind his grandfather&#x2019;s enormous desk in the sunroom, where Bosley would spend time writing. The interest in business would also last through most of his life. But it was an interest. Something to do. Not something to <i>be</i>. It wasn&#x2019;t firefighting.<br><br>The fireman&#x2019;s ideal was a magnet for Welles, as it is for so many boys of a certain age. The jubilant blast of the siren, the unpre�dictable call in the night, the monstrous gleam of the ladder truck, the fearsome power of the hose guns, the boots and turnouts and helmets, and the real and irresistible pull of fire&#x2014;its brilliance and drama and danger. A living thing, a real and attacking beast. The appeal lay in all of it, and something more, the chance to live out and execute an edict every child is taught but most forget fast: to help.<br><br>Christmas 1981, when Welles was four, his grandparents had a special gift for him, a blazing red ride-on fire truck. Upon first seeing it, Welles, who was formally dressed for the holiday in his little Eton suit, stood back for a few moments, as if uncertain how to proceed.<br><br>&#x201c;He was afraid to go near it,&#x201d; Alison said, picturing the scene. &#x201c;He couldn&#x2019;t believe it was real. He was just so in awe of his fire&nbsp;truck. Maybe he was trying to figure out how they shrunk the truck down.&#x201d; So Welles simply stared at the small metal engine, with its black wheels and bright chrome and beckoning seat behind the steering wheel. How did Santa get it down the chimney? Eventually, he walked toward it, sat down in it, and attempted to maneuver it around the room.<br><br>&#x201c;He climbed in and tried to pedal it,&#x201d; Alison said. &#x201c;It was not easy to pedal.&#x201d;<br><br>The pedals were indeed difficult to crank, and soon the gleaming red sides wore a coat of dust. Even though Welles would ride it at times down the sloped driveway, screaming with joy, wild to the world, he outgrew its small frame soon enough, and the toy went downstairs in a corner of the house somewhere, ignored and unused.<br><br>But the memory of the day, of the gift beside the tree and Welles under its spell, remains.</p><h2>How to Walk in Love</h2><p>Learn how to walk in love with Kenneth E.</p><p></p><h2>Earth Day Every Day (Cloverleaf Books &#x2122; &#x2015; Planet Protectors)</h2><p><p>On Earth Day, we find ways to help the Earth.

These illustrations will attract young readers to the environmental science content. The books cleverly use fictional stories to impart non-fiction information regarding taking care of the Earth. Trina, the lead character in the series, shares facts about Earth's water, pollution, conserving energy, and taking care of the planet. The books even question misconceptions some children have, such as the amount of water 'floating' in the body (see page 7 in Watch Over our Water). The books also contain 'circles of facts' which are written in a nonfiction narrative to describe scientific information that is being shared by Trina in the stories. These facts are written in child-friendly language and the information should be attainable by young children. Though the books are picture books which will keep young children's attention, they are also written as simple chapter books, complete with a Table of Contents, Glossary, Index, and references for further study. There are also activities for children to do to reinforce concepts from the stories. <strong>The books lend themselves to helping young children conceptualize ideas about the environment, as well as learn about the structure of an informational text. Teachers can share the books aloud with young children, or independent readers could read the books using the chapter by chapter format.

Preschoolers may not fully understand what the controversy is, whereas second graders may like to know more about it.

When asked how he felt about illustrating this book, Tim says, "My Christian faith is central to my life, so I jumped at the challenge to illustrate <i>Jesus Loves Me!</i> -- what a great way to use the gift God gave me!" Tim has drawn closely on his own experiences to give us a pictorial celebration of family life, and to share God's love for all of us. The hens you see in the pictures are from Tim's very own backyard.<br>With over forty picture books currently in print, award-winning illustrator Tim Warnes has been published in more than twenty countries. This is his first book with Simon &amp; Schuster.Kindergarten-Grade 2&#x2013;Warnes has illustrated this beloved childrens hymn with heartwarming depictions of three bears enjoying a variety of activities in their idyllic forest home. The pictures make it evident that the big, shaggy parents dote on their adorable cub. Together, they work in the garden, tend to the chickens, and go fishing. The father bear reads Bible stories to his child at bedtime, and mother bakes cookies with the tyke. The bears also color eggs to share with the other woodland creatures. Lines from the song are incorporated a few at a time into the spreads, appearing sometimes as dialogue balloons. The pictures, which are rendered in acrylic, water-soluble crayons, and ink, are suffused with the gentle light of a spring morning. The soothing greens and blues of the forest scenes and the warm tones of the bears snug home reinforce the reassuring message of the lyrics. The pictures tell a story of a loving and reverent family, and children will identify with the friendly characters. The musical score is included at the end of this delightful, finely illustrated work.&#x2013;<i>Linda L.

As General Tubman she was a Union spy. As Moses she led hundreds to freedom on the Underground Railroad. As Minty she was a slave whose spirit could not be broken. As Araminta she was a young girl whose father showed her the stars and the first steps on the path to freedom.<br><br>This lush, lyrical biography in verse begins with a glimpse of Harriet Tubman as an old woman, and travels back in time through the many roles she played through her life: spy, liberator, suggragist and more. Illustrated by James Ransome, whose paintings for <i>The Creation</i> won a Coretta Scott King medal, this is a riveting introduction to an American hero. <br><br>The paperback edition includes a new author's note, and a list of resources for further study. <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;A Junior Library Guild Selection<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;A Coretta Scott King Honor Book<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;A Christopher Award winner<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;A Jane Addams Children's Honor Book &lt;</p><p>. Lesa Cline-Ransome and James Ransome have collaborated on many award-winning picture books for children. These include <i>Satchel Paige</i>, which was an ALA Best Book for Children and <i>Words Set Me Free: The Story of Young Frederick Douglass</i>, which received starred reviews in <i>Booklist </i>and <i>School Library Journal</i>. <i>The Quilt Alphabet</i> was praised as "A blue-ribbon ABC book that combines bright, folksy oil paintings and lilting riddle-poems," in a starred review in <i>Publishers Weekly </i>and called "a feast for the eyes" in <i>School Library Journal</i>. They live in the Hudson River Valley region of New York.&#x2605;&nbsp;"Simultaneously simple enough for young children to understand and sophisticated enough to inspire adults."&#x2014;<b><i>Booklist</i>, Starred Review</b><br> &nbsp;<br>&#x2605;&nbsp;"A memorable, lyrical reverse-chronological walk through the life of an American icon. While the text introduces readers to the details of Tubman's life, Ransome's use of watercolor . . . reveals Tubman's humanity, determination, drive, and hope. Ransome's lavishly detailed and expansive double-page spreads situate young readers in each time and place as the text takes them further into the past."&#x2014;<b><i>Kirkus Reviews</i>, Starred Review</b><br> &nbsp;<br>&#x2605;&nbsp;"This striking reverse chronology opens with a regal portrait of an elderly Harriet Tubman, after which the Ransomes chart her decades of work in pursuit of equality. [Lesa Cline-Ransome&#x2019;s] incisive free verse emphasize[s] Tubman&#x2019;s bravery in the face of a multitude of dangers. James Ransome&#x2019;s watercolor portraits imbue Tubman with a steely determination&#x2015;at every age&#x2015;in lush scenes often set against blazing summer skies and blue, moonlit nights. Beyond its recognition of all that Tubman accomplished, the book serves as a powerful reminder of how all children carry within them the potential for greatness."&#x2014;<b><i>Publishers Weekly</i>, Starred Review</b><br> &nbsp;<br>&#x2605;&nbsp;"Each episode in her compelling life is illustrated by a luminous watercolor. The expertly done expressive paintings evoke Tubman&#x2019;s strength and integrity showing 'the wisp of a woman with the courage of a lion.' This lovely tribute effectively communicates Tubman&#x2019;s �everlasting bravery and resolve, and will �inspire curious readers to learn more."&#x2014;<b><i>School Library Journal</i>, Starred Review</b></p><h2>Click, Clack, Moo I Love You!

Artell avoids the temptation to throw in too many unfamiliar words, and places the handful of definitions for the Cajun terms he does use in a glossary at the beginning. The amusing verse scans well; the watercolor-and-pencil illustrations teem with details of Cajun life and add immeasurably to the fun. Petite Rouge is a goose in this version, with a perky cat, TeJean, for a companion. Readers are challenged to find a little mouse that appears in each picture and watches all of the goings-on. Of course, instead of the big bad wolf, there is Claude, "dat ol' gator," who frightens Grand-m&#x160;re into a closet and dons her clothing. When Rouge and TeJean notice Grand-m&#x160;re's huge teeth and realize they're in trouble, they throw a boudin (sausage) drenched in hot sauce into the villain's mouth, which does the trick. Claude, who thinks he has eaten Petite Rouge, jumps into the swamp to cool off. The last illustration shows him still dressed in Grand-m&#x160;re's pajamas, lying by his cypress tree, with signs all around him that say: "Don' feed dis gator." The text explains, "Ol' Claude reckon people/be too hot to eat./He don' know dat de hot sauce/done made all de heat." All in all, a treat from start to finish.</p><p><i>Judith Constantinides, formerly at East Baton Rouge Parish Main Library, LA</i></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>What Is a Scientist?</h2><p><p>Simple text and full-color photographs depict children engaged in various activities that make up the scientific process.</p></p><p><p>Author of&nbsp;<em>What Is a Scientist?.</em></p>Kindergarten-Grade 2-In a deceptively simple style, this little gem introduces the scientific process. It begins on the verso with the statement, "A scientist is a person who asks questions and tries different ways to answer them." On the recto, a large, clear, colorfully bordered photo shows a first-grade scientist engaged in that investigative step. Hanna is seen wondering about fruits and vegetables. She asks, "Are there this many peas in every pea pod?" Other students are shown noticing details, drawing what they see, taking notes, measuring, designing experiments, etc. The last two pages explain that a scientist keeps trying things over and over and, perhaps best of all, has fun. A final spread repeats the photographs in miniature and sums up what a scientist does. Without chapters, further-reading ideas, or even an index, this title reads like a picture book while conveying a positive message. An accessible volume that will prove especially useful in the classroom.<br><i>Anne Chapman Callaghan, Racine Public Library, WI</i><br>Copyright 1999 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Fancy Nancy: Sand Castles and Sand Palaces</h2><p><p>Join Fancy Nancy on a trip to the beach in <em>New York Times</em> bestselling team Jane O'Connor and Robin Preiss Glasser's 8x8 picture book, complete with a fabulous set of stickers.

He lives in Denver, Colorado.<br><br><b>Kristin E. Lindeen</b> is the oldest of seven Miller children and has been steeped in the <i>QBQ! </i>message of personal accountability. A keynote speaker and workshop leader, Kristin is also the creator of <i>I Own It! Building Character Through Personal Accountability</i>&#x2014;a classroom curriculum. Kristin lives in Maple Grove, Minnesota, with her husband Erik and three children.&nbsp;Chapter One &nbsp; A Picture of Personal Accountability &nbsp; An overworked young waiter goes above and beyond to deliver good service to a customer and pays for it out of pocket, too. Instead of shrugging off the situation by saying, "We don't serve Diet Coke," he goes the extra mile to get one across the street. This decision to solve the problem, made in the moment, makes all the difference. &nbsp; Key takeaway: Personal accountability turns a moment of frustration into an opportunity to contribute. &nbsp; 1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jacob's story makes you feel &nbsp; energized encouraged disbelief relief frustration a desire to change a craving for Diet Coke &nbsp; Summarize in one sentence your No. 1 takeaway from Jacob's story. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you had been Jacob, would you have stopped to serve the customer or kept on going to the kitchen? Why or why not? &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Underline in the QBQ definition below the words that are meaningful to you. The definition of the QBQ: &nbsp; A tool that enables individuals to practice personal accountability by making better choices in the moment. &nbsp; 4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If personal accountability is about "making better choices," identify two good choices you've made lately and two lousy ones. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The "Jacob and the Diet Coke" story is a metaphor for going the "extra mile" for another person. Fill in the blanks below: Think about whom you can get a "Diet Coke" for. Ask yourself the QBQ, "What can I do to serve ?"&nbsp; (Fill in that person's name.) &nbsp; The last time I had outstanding service like this was at . Having someone go the extra mile for me makes me feel . &nbsp; 6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What makes one person more accountable than another? Circle the things below that you believe drive individuals to be more accountable: &nbsp; upbringing life experiences self-discipline desire to win/compete energy thinking &nbsp; Which one or two do you need to work on in your life so you can practice more personal accountability? &nbsp; &nbsp; Chapter Two &nbsp; Making Better Choices &nbsp; Goatheads are prickly little thorns that grow in the prairie lands and stick to our shoes and pop bike tires. They are a metaphor for incorrect thinking like "I have to" or "I can't." These statements can stick in our minds and cause problems. Making the better choice to focus on good thoughts is key to practicing personal accountability. &nbsp; Key takeaway: Personal accountability is practiced by making better choices. &nbsp; 1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have good control over my thoughts. True or false? &nbsp; 2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Consider a time when you made a poor choice and landed in a "field of goatheads." Were you able to recover and get back on track? If so, how? What did you learn from the experience? &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reflect on this idea: Even deciding not to choose is making a choice. Think of something you decided not to do recently. Was it a good or bad decision? &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fill in the blank: People who believe they have no choice say things such as the following: &nbsp; I&nbsp; to. I . &nbsp; 5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Use this exercise to challenge yourself and think through your beliefs about the choices you have in life. &nbsp; Choices and Consequences exercise: &nbsp; I HAVE to do the laundry. True or false? (circle one) (Do you really have to?) Consequence of not doing the laundry: &nbsp; &nbsp; (There is freedom in realizing I don't have to do it, but "get" to or "choose" to because I don't like the alternative-dirty clothes!) &nbsp; I HAVE to pay my taxes. True or false? Consequence of not paying taxes: &nbsp; I HAVE to go to work. True or false? Consequence of not going to work: &nbsp; Create your own "HAVE to" statement: &nbsp; Consequence: I CAN'T exercise consistently. TRUTH: I have not created time in my schedule and could choose to make space for regular exercise. I CAN'T improve my relationships. TRUTH: I CAN'T share my true feelings. TRUTH: Create your own "CAN'T" statement: &nbsp; Rewrite and replace the "HAVEs" and "CAN'Ts" in your statements with "CHOOSE to's" and "CANs." &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; How does that change how you feel when you read your statements? When I use the phrase "I can't," I feel . When I use the phrase "I choose," I feel . &nbsp; 6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Summary of chapters 1 and 2: &nbsp; Personal accountability is the essence of QBQ, which is making better&nbsp; in the moment by asking better . (fill in the blanks) &nbsp; Chapter Three &nbsp; QBQ! The Question Behind the Question &nbsp; QBQ! is all about choosing to ask better questions, and the QBQ is always a better question. QBQs begin with "What" or "How," contain an "I," and focus on "action." Ask these better questions and begin to get better answers! &nbsp; Key takeaway: How to create the question behind the question-the QBQ. &nbsp; 1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fill in the blank: Better questions lead to better . &nbsp; 2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Underline the "better" questions: &nbsp; When are we going to solve that problem? How can I adapt to this change? Who didn't get me that information on time? What improvements can I make? &nbsp; Looking at the "better" questions you underlined, circle the pieces that match the three guidelines listed in the book. &nbsp; QBQ Guidelines qbqs always . . . 1. Begin with "What" or "How" 2. Contain an "I" 3. Focus on "Action" 3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fill in the blanks: QBQs . . . Begin with "" or "." Contain an "." Focus on "." QBQs do NOT start with "," "When," or "." QBQs do NOT contain the words "," "," or "" &nbsp; 4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To be clear, QBQs are generally asked of whom? Answer: . &nbsp; 5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let's take a quiz to determine which lousy questions you are most tempted to ask. Choose one answer for each of the scenarios below. Just have fun with it, and you can tally your "score" at the end. &nbsp; 1. You just found out you have to take a really difficult test for a certification at work that you didn't think you had to have. Which question below might you ask yourself? &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why didn't anyone clarify for me that I needed this? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When will they update the standards? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who was supposed to help me prepare? &nbsp; 2. You can't decide if you should quit your job and take a risk with a new venture or if you should play it safe and stay where you are. Your spouse doesn't have any opinion either way. What question would you ask? &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why doesn't s/he care about this decision? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who got me stuck at this point in life? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When will someone just tell me what choice to make? &nbsp; 3. You don't like your manager at your job. After a frustrating day when you were yelled at for being late, how do you respond? &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why is life so unfair? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who does this guy think he is, anyway? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When will someone get me up on time? &nbsp; 4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last week you forgot to take the garbage cans out to the curb, and your spouse got mad. What question might you ask yourself? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When will my husband/wife lay off me? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who is going to remind me to take out the trash from now on? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why do I have to do all the work? &nbsp; 5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your kids are begging for the next hot device. You just bought them one recently, but they're already bored with it. What question do you find yourself asking? &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who created these devices anyway? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why are my children so demanding? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When are my kids going to be more grateful? &nbsp; 6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You're overwhelmed thinking about finances and the future. How do you frame your thoughts on this? &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When is my financial adviser going to give me more guidance? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why is college so expensive? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who got me into all this debt? &nbsp; 7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of your closest friends hasn't been speaking to you lately. You know he is mad at you, but you're not sure why. How do you think about this conflict? &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who caused this problem in the first place? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why are my friends so hard to get along with? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When am I going to find better friends who don't take so much work? &nbsp; 8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You've heard that someone said something about you behind your back. The rumor is spreading quickly, and you're not sure how to stop it. What do you ask? &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When is someone else going to stand up for me and shut this rumor down? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why are other people so mean? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who's doing this to me? &nbsp; 9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You didn't get the promotion you applied for last year, but you worked really hard and improved during the past twelve months. You're the senior employee, and you think you've got a shot at this position. The announcement is made . . . and someone who's worked there less time got the job. How do you respond? &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who influenced the boss to side against me? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why don't I get what I deserve? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When will I catch a break? &nbsp; 10.&nbsp;&nbsp; Your significant other has been distant lately. You've tried hard to reach out and connect but can't figure out how to bridge the gap. What thoughts do you have about this? &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who's going to fix this? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When will s/he recognize that I'm trying my hardest? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why are relationships so hard? &nbsp; Add up your answers. How many&nbsp; questions did you choose? How many&nbsp; questions did you choose? How many&nbsp; questions did you choose? Key:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; = &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Blame" questions. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; =&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Procrastination" questions. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; =&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Complaining" or "Victim Thinking" questions. The shape with the largest number just might be the "trap" that you struggle with most. According to this quiz, my biggest struggle is&nbsp; &nbsp; . Call to Action What is the most important idea for me to apply from the introduction through chapter 3? &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What steps will I take to make this change? When will I start? Be as specific as possible. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; How will my life improve by taking this action? &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Chapter Four &nbsp; Don't Ask "Why?" &nbsp; Questions that begin with "Why" instead of "What" or "How" are lousy questions because they cause feelings of powerlessness. "Why me?" questions lead to victim thinking, which is a dangerous place to live. Want victim thinking eliminated from society? Then, as individuals, we must first eliminate it from ourselves. &nbsp; Key takeaway: Asking "Why" questions leads to victim thinking. &nbsp; 1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These four "Why" questions are given as examples of poor questions: &nbsp; "Why don't others work harder?" "Why is this happening to me?" "Why do they make it so difficult for me to do my job?" "Why don't people care as much as I do?" Write out two of the above questions that you are most at risk of asking. "Why ?" "Why ?" &nbsp; 2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; List those things you whine about frequently. Example: "I whine about people not being friendlier." &nbsp; I whine about . I whine about . I whine about . I whine about . &nbsp; I tend to play the victim when I feel (circle all that apply): &nbsp; defensive caught off guard angry out of control discouraged sad aggravated hurt Others: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; List some "Why" questions that you've been asking that have led you to play the victim, whine, and complain: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What if our world had absolutely NO victim thinking, whining, or complaining? What would be different? The same? Better? Worse? &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The best way to get rid of victim thinking in our world and society is to start with eliminating it in ourselves. What steps can you take to eliminate victim thinking in your life? &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There are three "better" questions-QBQs-listed below as alternatives to the "Why" questions that lead to victim thinking. "How can I do my job better today?" "What can I do to improve the situation?" "How can I support others?" &nbsp; Create your own below. &nbsp; "How ?" "What ?" "How ?" "?" "?" &nbsp; Chapter Five &nbsp; The Victim &nbsp; Years after returning to civilian life, a military man, once trained in the "no excuses" lifestyle of military service, realized he had fallen into the trap of victim thinking. Recognizing the series of "Why" questions he had been asking, he realized he'd become what he disliked most: the victim. A "no excuses" lifestyle is a better way to live. &nbsp; Key takeaway: "No excuses" thinking beats victim thinking. &nbsp; 1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why is it so easy for people to slip into excuse-making mode? List your thoughts/reasons: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How does a "no excuses" attitude lead to greater personal accountability? &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; List three excuses you hear others use: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; List three excuses you use: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finish this statement: I slip into excuse-making mode when I feel &nbsp; 5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; List the benefits eliminating excuses from your life would provide: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Chapter Six &nbsp; "Why Is This Happening to Me?" &nbsp; A reader of QBQ! believed she could disprove the idea that "stress is a choice." Thirty days later, she admitted that stress is a choice! Bad things happen, unexpected circumstances arise, but so often "stress" is mostly about how a person chooses to respond. &nbsp; Key takeaway: Stress is a choice. &nbsp; 1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stress is a choice. Agree or disagree? &nbsp; 2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What typically "stresses you out"? What "triggers" you to choose stress? &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These trigger events that have led you to choose stress in your life-were these choices avoidable? If so, how? &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Explain how embracing the idea that stress is a choice would enhance your daily living. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's important to recognize where stress and tension begin. Yes, bad things happen, and life can be hard, but so often it's the individual's response that creates increased levels of stress. Will you commit to owning the concept that "I create my own stress!"? Circle Yes or No . . . it's always a choice! Reflect on this concept, and your response of yes or no. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Chapter Seven &nbsp; "Why Do We Have to Go Through &nbsp; All This Change?" &nbsp; A pilot and his young daughter Sta...</p><h2>Storm Clouds Rolling In (# 1 in the Bregdan Chronicles Historical Fiction Romanc</h2><p><p><b><em><strong></strong></em>#1 in The Bregdan Chronicles by Best-Selling Author, Ginny Dye.&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></p><p><em><strong>Review:&nbsp;&nbsp;Best Historical Fiction series I have ever read!&nbsp; Keep them coming! ~ Dotti</strong></em></p><p><strong>Review:</strong>&nbsp;I expected to like this book.&nbsp;<em><strong>I did not expect to be hooked!&nbsp;</strong></em>This series is, quite simply, the best historical fiction I have ever read.

What price will she be willing to pay as America crumbles into war?</p><p>________________________</p><p>This first book of The Bregdan Chronicles historical fiction series will pull you in and never let you go. You'll experience the Civil War era (and all the years to come) through the eyes of both White and Black, free &amp; slave, Southern &amp; Northern - and you'll fall in love with every character. How many books will there be? Ginny has no idea - she&nbsp;intends to write these character's stories for as long as she&nbsp;can!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Review:</strong>&nbsp;I never thought I would find a series&nbsp;to enthrall me like The Bregdan Chronicles has.&nbsp;I was wrong!&nbsp;I am struggling to find appropriate words to describe the awe I am in, and I find myself failing miserably. I absolutely could not put these books down. I would finish one, and immediately hop online to go get the next one....sometimes in the wee hours of the morning, when my tail should have been asleep. The writing style of this author brings you right into the story as if you are a part of it. She has amazing talent to capture the imagination, and bring you right into a virtual reality. I have fallen in love with every one of these characters - especially the strong women! - and have become completely entranced with each life represented.</p><p>The historical account of this time period was so right on, so very vivid, you almost feel like you've walked right into it. These books became so alive, I actually had dreams at night of battle. (I'm not even kidding.) But it goes further. There were conversations in these books that had me reading over them several times. Life lessons. Sage advice. The kind of wisdom that comes from every day life. Moments that were so profound, they pierced my heart with an accuracy that I can't even begin to explain. Many times, the lives and hearts of each character were changed and rocked with revelation that came about in a moment, yet, so deeply touching the deepest recesses of the heart, that you can't go beyond it, without it having changed you as well, as you read it.</p><p>Thank you Ginny Dye...not only for an amazing journey....but for those light bulb moments,throughout each book, that reached beyond the pages, and made their home inside the soul. What can I say overall? Well, let me put it like this: these books are like... "Gone with the Wind" meets up with "Eat,Pray,Love"; then whispers some "Secret life of Bees", forges some "Steel Magnolia's", and at times, wraps itself with the "Color Purple."&nbsp;<em><strong>Sigh. Did I mention how much I loved these books?</strong></em></p></p><p><p>Ginny would love to get to know every single person who reads her books. Since that isn't possible she can at least let you get to know her a little. Born in North Carolina, she is a wanderer at heart. She has lived all over the United States, exploring every state and having wonderful adventures along the way. She has managed horse ranches in Texas and Oregon; worked with teenagers all over the country (she love them!), and has hiked, biked, rafted and played in every locale she could. </p> <p>She loves all the beaches, deserts, woods, and mountains she has traveled through but when she discovered Washington, she discovered home. Her heart is at home there with the snow covered mountains; the glistening waters of the Pacific; the eagles and Orca whales; the towering fir trees surrounding her home; and the miles of trails on her own Magic Mountain. </p> <p>Everywhere she looks inspires her to be all she can be - to follow and achieve all the dreams of her heart! She managed to write and publish 16 books along the way. She enjoys writing many different genres but admits Historical Fiction is her favorite. She is quite sure she will never live long enough to write all her heart and mind holds, but she certainly intends to try! </p> <p>She is also the Founder of Millions For Positive Change. This fabulous organization is committed to creating a world-wide community of people with a passion to make a difference and live their best life - using the multitude of FREE resources provided. </p> <p>Her life will forever be a journey. She knows she will never get to the place where she thinks she has "arrived". The more she learns - the more she knows she doesn't know! Yet. what joy she receives by sharing the light she has... She would love to hear from you at BregdanChronicles.net</p></p><h2>Hello, World!

On the morning of Miguel's 15th birthday, he receives a note from his father telling him that it is time for him to join them. Miguel is sad to leave his grandmother and sister behind, but is excited about being reunited with his parents. Unbeknownst to Miguel, Elena, 13, disguises herself and joins him on the difficult journey. They are robbed, threatened, and almost perish in a desperate trek across the desert. The pacing of the plot is quick and driven, and the characters are realistically drawn. They interact as true siblings do, sometimes with love and sometimes not. Cultural and geographical background information is expertly woven into the novel. The author creates a mood of desperation and anxiety as the story unfolds and Miguel and Elena discover that crossing <i>la l�nea</i> will forever change the way they look at themselves and the world. Although the epilogue illuminates their lives as adults, the novel ends abruptly, leaving readers without the anticipated emotional release of their reunion with their parents.<i>-Melissa Christy Buron, Epps Island Elementary, Houston, TX</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

They so strongly prefer it that when they go to a foreign country they just talk louder, maybe slower, because they think they will be better understood. But more than <i>talking</i> in their own language, people like to hear things in a way they are most comfortable. The way they are used to. The way they can most easily relate to, as if that makes it more real. So I will try to tell this story in that way. </p><p> And I will tell this story in first person. </p><p> <i>I</i> not <i>he</i>. <i>Me</i> not <i>him</i>. <i>Mine</i> not <i>his</i>. </p><p> In a neurotypical way. </p><p> I will try -- </p><p> To tell my story in their language, in your language. </p><p> I am Jason Blake. </p><p> And this is what someone would say, if they looked at me but could only see and could only hear in their own language: </p><p> That kid is weird (he's in SPED, you know). He blinks his eyes, sometimes one at a time. Sometimes both together. They open and close, open and close, letting the light in, shutting it out. The world blinks on and off. </p><p> And he flaps his hands, like when he is excited or just before he is going to say something, or when he is thinking. He does that the most when he's on the computer or reading a book. When his mind is focused on the words, it separates from his body, his body that almost becomes a burden, a weight. </p><p> Weight. </p><p> Wait. </p><p> Only his fingers don't stand still while they wait. They flap at the ends of his hands, at the ends of his wrists. </p><p> Like insects stuck on a string, stuck in a net. Like maybe they want to fly away. Maybe he does too. </p><p> In first grade they put a thick, purple rubber band across the bottom bar of his desk chair, so Jason would have something to jiggle with his feet when he was supposed to be sitting still. In second grade Matthew Iverson sent around a note saying, <i>If you think Jason Blake is a retard, sign this</i>, and Matthew got sent to the principal's office, which only made things worse for Jason. </p><p> In third grade Jason Blake was diagnosed with ASD, autistic spectrum disorder. But his mother will never use that term. She prefers three different letters: NLD, nonverbal learning disorder. Or these letters: PDD-NOS, pervasive developmental disorder- non-specific. When letters are put together, they can mean so much, and they can mean nothing at all. </p><p> From third grade until this year, sixth grade, Jason had a one-on-one aide, who followed him around school all day. She weighed two hundred and three pounds. (Jason asked her once, and she told him.) You couldn't miss seeing her. </p><p> But the thing people see the most is his silence, because some kinds of silence are actually visible. </p><p> When I write, I can be heard. And known. </p><p> But nobody has to look at me. Nobody has to see me at all. </p><p> School doesn't always go very well. It is pretty much a matter of time before the first thing of the day will go wrong. </p><p> But today I've gotten far. It is already third period. Mrs. Hawthorne is absent and so we are going to the library instead of art class. This is a good sign. You'd think art class would be one of the easiest classes, but it's not. I mean, it's not that it's hard like math, but it's hard like PE. A lot of space and time that is not organized. </p><p> Anything can go wrong in that kind of space. </p><p> But not in the library. There are computers in the library. And books. And computers. Keyboards and screens and desks that are built inside little compartments so you don't have to look at the person sitting next to you. And they can't look at me. </p><p> When we get into the library, somebody is already sitting in my seat, at my computer. At the one I want. Now I can't breathe. I want to log on to my Storyboard website. I was thinking about it all the way here. I have already had to wait so long. I don't know. </p><p> "Jason, this one is free," the lady says. She puts her hands on my shoulders. This lady is a lady I should know, but her face looks like a lot of other faces I don't know so well, and I group them all together. Her face is pinched, but her eyes are big, round like circles. Her hair doesn't move, like it's stuck in a ball. She belongs in the library or the front office or my dentist's office. </p><p> But she is here now, so I will assume she is the librarian. </p><p> I know from experience that she is trying to help me, but it doesn't. I can feel her weight on my shoulders like metal cutting my body right off my head. This is not a good thing. </p><p> I also know she wants me to look at her. </p><p> Neurotypicals like it when you look them in the eye. It is supposed to mean you are listening, as if the reverse were true, which it is not: Just because you are not looking at someone does not mean you are not listening. I can listen better when I am not distracted by a person's face: </p><p> <i>What are their eyes saying? </i></p><p><i> Is that a frown or a smile? </i></p><p><i> Why are they wrinkling their forehead or lifting their cheeks like that? What does that mean?</i> </p><p> How can you listen to all those words when you have to think about all that stuff? </p><p> But I know I will get in trouble if I don't look at the lady's eyes. I can force myself. I turn my head, but I will look at her sideways. </p><p> I know the right words to use. </p><p> Last year Jane, my one-on-one, taught me to say, "I am okay just as I am." </p><p> <i>I am okay just as I am.</i> </p><p> She told me I had to say something in this sort of situation. She said that people expect certain things. She said that people will misunderstand me if I don't say something. </p><p> This is one of the many, many things I need to run through in my mind, every time. Also the things my OT, my occupational therapist, has taught me: </p><p> Look people in the eye when you are talking (even if this makes it harder for you to listen). </p><p> Talk, even when you have nothing to say (that's what NTs do all the time). </p><p> Try to ignore everything else around you (even when those things may be very important). </p><p> If possible put your head and your body back together and try very hard not to shake or flap or twirl or twitch (even if it makes you feel worse to do this). </p><p> Don't blink. </p><p> Don't click your teeth. (These are the things people don't like. These are the things they hear but can't hear). </p><p> "I am okay just as I am," I say, and I take a step forward. I want the librarian to take her hands off my shoulders. The weight of her hands is almost unbearable, like lead. Like the lead apron the dentist puts on you when you get an x-ray, a crushing rock while the technician counts to ten. And you can't move. </p><p> Or they will have to do it all over again. </p><p> Also, I want to stand close, so there will be no confusion that I am next in line. The person at the computer turns around to the sound of my voice. It is a girl. Most girls look the same, and I can't tell one from the other. </p><p> Long hair. Earrings. Different tone of voice. </p><p> A Girl. </p><p> I don't know who this girl is, or if she already hates me, but chances are she does. </p><p> The girl doesn't say anything, so I have to look at her face and figure it out. Her eyes are squinched up, and her lips are pressed so tightly together they almost disappear. I recognize that she is unhappy or even angry, but I don't know why. </p><p> "You are breathing on me," she says. "You're so gross." </p><p> "Gross" could mean big or refer to a measurement or weight, but in this case it doesn't. It means she doesn't like me. She is, in fact, repulsed by me, which is how most girls react. My mom tells me not to worry. My mom tells me I will find a girlfriend one day, just like everyone else. I will find someone who sees how "special" I am. I know no girl will ever like me. No matter what I do, no matter how hard I try. </p><p> But maybe I am wrong. </p><p> I hope so. </p><p> I hope I am wrong and my mother is right. But usually I am right about these things. </p><p> "I was here first, Miss Leno," the girl says. </p><p> <i>Miss Leno is the librarian's name.</i> </p><p> "Jason, here," Miss Leno is saying. "Sit here. You can use this computer." </p><p> But I can't use that computer. I don't want to. I can't. My breathing is too loud inside my ears. I stiffen my body, solidify my weight, so she can't move me with her hands. You'd be surprised at how quickly people will try to move you with their hands when they don't get what they want with their words. </p><p> I wish Jane were here with me right now and then this wouldn't happen. Words don't always work. </p><p> "Jason, hold still. There's no need to get so upset. There are plenty of other computers." </p><p> Miss Leno is trying to shift my weight off my feet, and she's trying to pretend she's not, as if she's just walking with me, instead of pushing me, which is what she's doing. </p><p> "Jason, please." But she doesn't mean <i>please</i>. There is no <i>please</i> in anything Miss Leno is asking. She is pulling me. </p><p> I feel off balance, like I am going to fall. I need to shift my weight back and forth, back and forth, rock to stabilize myself. I can feel my chance to use my computer getting further and further away from me. There isn't even enough time left in the period. I might not get to log on at all, even if this girl does get up. A hundred little pieces threaten to come apart. </p><p> "Jason, please, calm down. Calm down." Miss Leno's voice sounds like a Xerox machine. </p><p> Sometimes there is nothing to hold me together. </p><p> Copyright � 2009 by Nora Raleigh Baskin</p></p><h2>Creative Haven Mandalas Color by Number Coloring Book (Adult Coloring)</h2><p><p>Offering unlimited opportunities for shading and color choices, mandalas can be among the most challenging designs to color.

A baby was kidnapped on board the rescue ship, the Carpathia, by a woman who had lost her child. Jack Thayer, who never got over the death of his son in the water, took his own life thirty years after the sinking. </p><p> Illustrated with dozens of accurate paintings, diagrams and rare photographs, the book's special features include the making of James Cameron's movie <i>Titanic</i>, a true-or-false quiz and the real-life stories of the young people who sailed on the fateful voyage. </p><p> <i>882 1/2 Amazing Answers to Your Questions About the Titanic</i> is a must-have purchase for all Titanic enthusiasts. </p></p><p><p> Hugh Brewster is the author of several books for children and young adults, including <i>Gilded Lives, Fatal Voyage: The Titanic's First-Class Passengers and Their World</i>. </p><p> Laurie Coulter is a children's book author who specializes in historical nonfiction. Her books include <i>To Be a Princess</i>. She lives in Toronto. </p><p> Ken Marschall is a painter best known as the world's foremost creator of Titanic artwork. His books include <i>Titanic: An Illustrated History</i>, a <i>Globe and Mail</i> bestseller. He lives in Redondo Beach, California. </p>It is the personal detail about the passengers and crew members (Question 340: Were there any movie stars?; Question 483: Did any passengers refuse to enter the lifeboats?; Question 532: What happened to Captain Smith?) that sets this apart from other children's books about the Titanic. There is a lot to be learned about a notable historical event here, but, in addition, there is attention to the human side and the human scale of things that will make this a useful resource and an interesting read for school and public library collections that need a new or replacement copy of the book.

During his career as an artist, sketching impressions of Broadway shows for the<i>&nbsp;New York Times&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<i>The Herald Tribune,&nbsp;</i>he was introduced to the world of children&#x2019;s literature when William Saroyan asked him to illustrate several books. Soon after, he began to write and illustrate his own books, a career he settled into comfortably and happily. Through his writing, he was able to create his own theater: "I love the flow of turning the pages, the suspense of what's next. Ideas just come at me and after me. It's all so natural. I work all the time, long into the night, and it's such a pleasure. I don't know when the time ends. I've never been happier in my life!" He created many beloved characters in his lifetime, perhaps the most beloved among them a stuffed, overall-wearing bear named Corduroy.</p><h2>Old MacDonald Had a Truck: (Preschool Read Aloud Books, Books for Kids, Kids Construction Books)</h2><p>Old MacDonald had a farm E-I-E-I-O. And on that farm he had a...TRUCK?! With a DIG DIG here and a SCOOP SCOOP there, this classic folk song just got revved up! Beloved machines&#x2014;the excavator, dump truck, bulldozer, and more&#x2014;will have the vehicle-obsessed of all ages reading and singing along.</p><p>Steve Goetz was inspired to write his debut picture book after his son began to sing "Old MacDonald Had a Farm" with alternative lyrics. He lives with his family in San Francisco.<br><br>Eda Kaban is a native of Turkey. She now teaches at Academy of Art University, in addition to exhibiting work in galleries and illustrating children's books. She lives in San Francisco.PreS-Gr 1&#x2014;A new twist on a classic story and song, this book is just pure fun. All readers know about Old MacDonald and the things on his farm. But they will love the new toys he has in this tale. All the usual animal friends are present in the illustrations, but he's also got excavators, bulldozers, and dump trucks. The lyrics of the song may have a nonsense-type flow, but that will make singing/telling the story that much more fun. The illustrations are rich and tell as much of the story as the text does. Gender roles are slightly flipped, as Old MacDonald's partner in the book is a woman who clearly knows her way around the farm and a steamroller, too. This is a book that could be used to teach a multitude of lessons.

Danforth's personal philosophy of "Four-square" personal development. Much more than a primer on the mechanics of balanced success, it is a riveting and motivational incitement to action. This brief book will provide you with the roadmap for success as well as a jolt of energy encouraging you to follow that path and fulfill your potential.&nbsp; William H. Danforth, who founded the Nestle Purina company, saw life as a type of checkerboard. Danforth believed that four key components (or "squares") &#x2013; the mental, the physical, the social, and the religious &#x2013; needed to be in balance in order to achieve fulfillment and success in life. &nbsp;He encapsulated his ideas in <em>I Dare You!</em>, a book he published in 1931 &nbsp;ago in which he urges readers of any age to take chances and fulfill their full potential through his strategies of becoming a more risk-taking person.</p></p><p>William H. Danforth founded the Ralston Purina Company in St. Louis, Missouri. He co-founded the American Youth Foundation (AYF) to train young men and women in Christian ideals and help them prepare for a life of responsibility and leadership. As president of the American Youth Foundation, Mr. Danforth helped establish Camp Miniwanca, a 300-acre campsite near Shelby, Michigan<br><br>that he established while he was president of AYF for the purpose of helping young people. For more than 30 years, up to the time of his death, Mr. Danforth spent his summers at Camp Miniwanca where he met, counseled and inspired thousands of young men and women. He also established the Danforth Foundation as a national educational philanthropy.<br><br>His passion for helping individuals to fulfill destiny stirred him to write I Dare You. The dominant message of the book proposes that, for an individual to be healthy, the four key components in life need to be in balance at all times Physical, Mental, Social, and Religious.</p><h2>Grandma&#39;s Purse</h2><p><b>Spend the day with a grandma and granddaughter in this charming picture book about the magic found in their favorite accessory, perfect for readers who love <i>How to Babysit a Grandma</i>!&nbsp;</b><br><br> When Grandma Mimi comes to visit, she always brings warm hugs, sweet treats...and her purse.
